	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance is of concern to global health security worldwide. We aimed to identify the prevalence, resistance patterns, and risk factors associated with Escherichia coli (E. coli) resistance from poultry farms in Kelantan, Terengganu, and Pahang states of east coast peninsular Malaysia. Between 8 February 2019 and 23 February 2020, a total of 371 samples (cloacal swabs = 259; faecal = 84; Sewage = 14, Tap water = 14) were collected. Characteristics of the sampled farms including management type, biosecurity, and history of disease were obtained using semi-structured questionnaire. Presumptive E. coli isolates were identified based on colony morphology with subsequent biochemical and {PCR} confirmation. Susceptibility of isolates was tested against a panel of 12 antimicrobials and interpreted alongside risk factor data obtained from the surveys. We isolated 717 E. coli samples from poultry and environmental samples. Our findings revealed that cloacal (17.8\%, 46/259), faecal (22.6\%, 19/84), sewage (14.3\%, 2/14) and tap water (7.1\%, 1/14) were significantly (p \&lt; 0.003) resistant to at least three classes of antimicrobials. Resistance to tetracycline class were predominantly observed in faecal samples (69\%, 58/84), followed by cloacal (64.1\%, 166/259), sewage (35.7\%, 5/14), and tap water (7.1\%, 1/84), respectively. Sewage water ({OR} = 7.22, 95\% {CI} = 0.95\&ndash;151.21) had significant association with antimicrobial resistance ({AMR}) acquisition. Multivariate regression analysis identified that the risk factors including sewage samples ({OR} = 7.43, 95\% {CI} = 0.96\&ndash;156.87) and farm size are leading drivers of E. coli antimicrobial resistance in the participating states of east coast peninsular Malaysia. We observed that the resistance patterns of E. coli isolates against 12 panel antimicrobials are generally similar in all selected states of east coast peninsular Malaysia. The highest prevalence of resistance was recorded in tetracycline (91.2\%), oxytetracycline (89.1\%), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (73.1\%), doxycycline (63\%), and sulfamethoxazole (63\%). A close association between different risk factors and the high prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli strains reflects increased exposure to resistant bacteria and suggests a concern over rising misuse of veterinary antimicrobials that may contribute to the future threat of emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogen isolates. Public health interventions to limit antimicrobial resistance need to be tailored to local poultry farm practices that affect bacterial transmission.},

	abstract = {The burden of antimicrobial use in agricultural settings is one of the greatest challenges facing global health and food security in the modern era. Malaysian poultry operations are a relevant but understudied component of epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. We aimed to identify the prevalence, resistance patterns, and risk factors associated with Salmonella isolates from poultry farms in three states of East Coast Peninsular Malaysia. Between 8 February 2019 and 23 February 2020, a total of 371 samples (cloacal swabs = 259; faecal = 84; Sewage = 14, Tap water = 14) was collected from poultry operations. Characteristics of the sampled farms and associated risk factors were obtained using semi-structured questionnaires. Presumptive Salmonella spp. isolates were identified based on colony morphology with subsequent biochemical and {PCR} confirmation. Susceptibility of isolates was tested against a panel of 12 antimicrobials using disk diffusion method. Our findings revealed that the proportion of Salmonella spp.-positive isolates across sample source were as following: cloacal swab (46.3\%, 120/259); faecal (59.5\%, 50/84); in tap water (14.3\%, 2/14); and in sewage sample (35.7\%, 5/14). Isolates from faecal (15.5\%, 13/84), cloacal (1.2\%, 3/259), and sewage (7.1\%, 1/14) samples were significantly resistant to at least five classes of antimicrobials. Resistance to Sulfonamides class (52\%, 92/177) was predominantly observed followed by tetracycline (39.5\%, 70/177) and aminoglycosides (35.6\%, 63/177). Multivariate regression analysis identified intensive management system ({OR} = 1.55, 95\% {CI} = 1.00â€“2.40) as a leading driver of antimicrobial resistance ({AMR}) acquisition. A prevalence of resistance to common antimicrobials was recorded for sulfamethoxazole (33.9\%), tetracycline (39.5\%), and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (37.9\%). A close association between different risk factors and the prevalence of {AMR} of Salmonella strains suggests a concern over rising misuse of veterinary antimicrobials that may contribute to the emergence and evolution of multidrug-resistant pathogen isolates. One Health approach is recommended to achieve a positive health outcome for all species.},
