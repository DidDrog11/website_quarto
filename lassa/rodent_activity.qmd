title: "Investigating rodent activity within houses in Eastern Sierra Leone."
abstract: "The location of human infection with Lassa Fever is not known. Humans may encounter rodents in various habitats in endemic regions. We were interested in how rodents use space within human houses and so alongside our rodent trapping studies we deployed camera traps to observe their behaviour."
