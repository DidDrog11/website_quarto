	abstract = {Land use change-for example, the conversion of natural habitats to agricultural or urban ecosystems-is widely recognized to influence the risk and emergence of zoonotic disease in humans1,2. However, whether such changes in risk are underpinned by predictable ecological changes remains unclear. It has been suggested that habitat disturbance might cause predictable changes in the local diversity and taxonomic composition of potential reservoir hosts, owing to systematic, trait-mediated differences in species resilience to human pressures3,4. Here we analyse 6,801 ecological assemblages and 376 host species worldwide, controlling for research effort, and show that land use has global and systematic effects on local zoonotic host communities. Known wildlife hosts of human-shared pathogens and parasites overall comprise a greater proportion of local species richness (18-72\% higher) and total abundance (21-144\% higher) in sites under substantial human use (secondary, agricultural and urban ecosystems) compared with nearby undisturbed habitats. The magnitude of this effect varies taxonomically and is strongest for rodent, bat and passerine bird zoonotic host species, which may be one factor that underpins the global importance of these taxa as zoonotic reservoirs. We further show that mammal species that harbour more pathogens overall (either human-shared or non-human-shared) are more likely to occur in human-managed ecosystems, suggesting that these trends may be mediated by ecological or life-history traits that influence both host status and tolerance to human disturbance5,6. Our results suggest that global changes in the mode and the intensity of land use are creating expanding hazardous interfaces between people, livestock and wildlife reservoirs of zoonotic disease.},

	abstract = {Many major human pathogens are multihost pathogens, able to infect other vertebrate species. Describing the general patterns of host–pathogen associations across pathogen taxa is therefore important to understand risk factors for human disease emergence. However, there is a lack of comprehensive curated databases for this purpose, with most previous efforts focusing on viruses. Here, we report the largest manually compiled host–pathogen association database, covering 2,595 bacteria and viruses infecting 2,656 vertebrate hosts. We also build a tree for host species using nine mitochondrial genes, giving a quantitative measure of the phylogenetic similarity of hosts. We find that the majority of bacteria and viruses are specialists infecting only a single host species, with bacteria having a significantly higher proportion of specialists compared to viruses. Conversely, multihost viruses have a more restricted host range than multihost bacteria. We perform multiple analyses of factors associated with pathogen richness per host species and the pathogen traits associated with greater host range and zoonotic potential. We show that factors previously identified as important for zoonotic potential in viruses—such as phylogenetic range, research effort, and being vector-borne—are also predictive in bacteria. We find that the fraction of pathogens shared between two hosts decreases with the phylogenetic distance between them. Our results suggest that host phylogenetic similarity is the primary factor for host-switching in pathogens.},

Here we update a global database of emerging infectious disease ({EID}) events, create a novel measure of reporting effort, and fit boosted regression tree models to analyze the demographic, environmental and biological correlates of their occurrence. After accounting for reporting effort, we show that zoonotic {EID} risk is elevated in forested tropical regions experiencing land-use changes and where wildlife biodiversity (mammal species richness) is high. We present a new global hotspot map of spatial variation in our zoonotic {EID} risk index, and partial dependence plots illustrating relationships between events and predictors.

	abstract = {Leptospirosis essentially affects human following contact with rodent urine-contaminated water. As such, it was mainly found associated with rice culture, recreational activities and flooding. This is also the reason why it has mainly been investigated in temperate as well as warm and humid regions, while arid zones have been only very occasionally monitored for this disease. In particular, data for West African countries are extremely scarce. Here, we took advantage of an extensive survey of urban rodents in Niamey, Niger, in order to look for rodent-borne pathogenic Leptospira species presence and distribution across the city. To do so, we used high throughput bacterial 16S-based metabarcoding, {lipL}32 gene-targeting {RT}-{PCR}, rrs gene sequencing and {VNTR} typing as well as {GIS}-based multivariate spatial analysis. Our results show that leptospires seem absent from the core city where usual Leptospira reservoir rodent species (namely R. rattus and M. natalensis) are yet abundant. On the contrary, L. kirschneri was detected in Arvicanthis niloticus and Cricetomys gambianus, two rodent species that are restricted to irrigated cultures within the city. Moreover, the {VNTR} profiles showed that rodent-borne leptospires in Niamey belong to previously undescribed serovars. Altogether, our study points towards the importance of market gardening in maintain and circulation of leptospirosis within Sahelian cities. In Africa, irrigated urban agriculture constitutes a pivotal source of food supply, especially in the context of the ongoing extensive urbanization of the continent. With this in mind, we speculate that leptospirosis may represent a zoonotic disease of concern also in arid regions that would deserve to be more rigorously surveyed, especially in urban agricultural settings., We surveyed rodent-borne Leptospira in rodents from Niamey, the capital town of Niger, using bacterial metabarcoding, {RT}-{PCR}, sequencing, {VNTR} typing and {GIS}-based geostatistics. Two new serovars of Leptospira kirschneri were identified in Arvicanthis niloticus and Cricetomys gambianus, two species that inhabit exclusively urban irrigated gardens. Since no rodent-borne leptospires could be found in the core city, our results point towards the importance of urban agriculture in the maintaining and the circulation of these bacteria in cities from semi-arid regions where they are usually poorly documented and even hardly looked for. Accordingly, this is one of the very rare mentions of these zoonotic agents in Sahel, and the first one in Niger. Keeping in mind the critical role of urban gardening for food security in extensively growing West African cities, we believe that leptospirosis should be more closely scrutinized in Sahelian countries where numerous cases of human fevers are of unknown origin.},

	abstract = {Populations of large wildlife are declining on local and global scales. The impacts of this pulse of size-selective defaunation include cascading changes to smaller animals, particularly rodents, and alteration of many ecosystem processes and services, potentially involving changes to prevalence and transmission of zoonotic disease. Understanding linkages between biodiversity loss and zoonotic disease is important for both public health and nature conservation programs, and has been a source of much recent scientific debate. In the case of rodent-borne zoonoses, there is strong conceptual support, but limited empirical evidence, for the hypothesis that defaunation, the loss of large wildlife, increases zoonotic disease risk by directly or indirectly releasing controls on rodent density. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally excluding large wildlife from a savanna ecosystem in East Africa, and examining changes in prevalence and abundance of Bartonella spp. infection in rodents and their flea vectors. We found no effect of wildlife removal on per capita prevalence of Bartonella infection in either rodents or fleas. However, because rodent and, consequently, flea abundance doubled following experimental defaunation, the density of infected hosts and infected fleas was roughly twofold higher in sites where large wildlife was absent. Thus, defaunation represents an elevated risk in Bartonella transmission to humans (bartonellosis). Our results (i) provide experimental evidence of large wildlife defaunation increasing landscape-level disease prevalence, (ii) highlight the importance of susceptible host regulation pathways and host/vector density responses in biodiversity–disease relationships, and (iii) suggest that rodent-borne disease responses to large wildlife loss may represent an important context where this relationship is largely negative.},

Lassa fever has been seldom investigated outside of a few hyperendemic regions, where the described epidemiology may differ from that in areas of low or moderate incidence of disease. Through a prospective cohort study, we investigated the epidemiology and clinical presentation of Lassa fever in Guinea, where the disease has been infrequently recognized. A surveillance system was established, and suspected cases were enrolled at five Guinean hospitals. Clinical observations were made, and blood was taken for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing and isolation of Lassa virus. Lassa fever was confirmed in 22 (7\%) of 311 suspected cases. Another 43 (14\%) had Lassa {IgG} antibodies, indicating past exposure. Both sexes and a wide variety of age and ethnic groups were affected. The disease was more frequently found, and the {IgG} seroprevalence generally higher, in the southeastern forest region. In some areas, there were significant discrepancies between the incidence of Lassa fever and the prevalence of antibody. Clinical presentations between those with Lassa fever and other febrile illnesses were essentially indistinguishable. Clinical predictors of a poor outcome were noted, but again were not specific for Lassa fever. Case-fatality rates for those with Lassa fever and non-Lassa febrile illnesses were 18\% and 15\%, respectively. Seasonal fluctuation in the incidence of Lassa fever was noted, but occurred similarly with non-Lassa febrile illnesses. Our results, perhaps typical of the scenario throughout much of West Africa, indicate Lassa virus infection to be widespread in certain areas of Guinea, but difficult to distinguish clinically.},

Zoonotic transmission occurs when humans are directly or indirectly exposed to fluids of the multimammate mouse, such as urine, saliva, and blood. Housing characteristics and domestic organization affect rodent density in and around households and villages, and are likely to be a risk factor for Lassa fever in humans where the reservoir exists. We use semi-structured interviews (N = 51), a quantitative survey (N = 429), direct observations, and a rodent ecology study to provide new insights into how the organization of domestic spaces brings together humans and rodents and creates pathways for infection in rural settlements in Bo District, Sierra Leone. Rodents were frequently reported inside houses (92.4\% of respondents), in which we predominantly trapped M. natalensis (57\% of trapped rodents) and Rattus rattus (38\% of trapped rodents). Building design and materials provide hiding and nesting places for rodents and lead to close proximity with humans. Patterns of contact are both unintentional and intentional and research participants reported high levels of contact with rodents (34.2\% of respondents) and rodent fluids (52.8\% of respondents). Rodents are also perceived as a serious threat to food security. These results present detailed knowledge about how humans live with and come into contact with rodents, including the {LASV} reservoir. Our results argue for further collaborative research in housing and environmental modification such as ceiling construction, food storage, and sanitation as prevention against zoonotic {LASV} transmission.},

	abstract = {In order to evaluate the contribution of geological, environmental, and climatic changes to the spatial distribution of genetic variation of Mastomys natalensis, we analysed cytochrome b sequences from the whole distribution area of the species to infer its phylogeographic structure and historical demography. Six well-supported phylogroups, differentiated during the Pleistocene, were evidenced. No significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances was found at the continental scale, and the geographic distributions of the observed phylogroups have resulted from extensive periods of isolation caused by the presence of putative geographic and ecological barriers. The diversification events were probably influenced by habitat contraction/expansion cycles that may have complemented topographic barriers to induce genetic drift and lineage sorting. According to our results, we propose a scenario where climate-driven processes may have played a primary role in the differentiation among phylogroups. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London},

In this article, we report an analysis of the epidemiologic and clinical aspects of the {LF} outbreak that occurred in Nigeria during January 1–May 6, 2018. A total of 1,893 cases were reported; 423 were laboratory-confirmed cases, among which 106 deaths were recorded (case-fatality rate 25.1\%). Among all confirmed cases, 37 occurred in healthcare workers. The secondary attack rate among 5,001 contacts was 0.56\%. Most (80.6\%) confirmed cases were reported from 3 states (Edo, Ondo, and Ebonyi). Fatal outcomes were significantly associated with being elderly; no administration of ribavirin; and the presence of a cough, hemorrhaging, and unconsciousness. The findings in this study should lead to further {LF} research and provide guidance to those preparing to respond to future outbreaks.},

	abstract = {As part of a large survey on reservoirs of Lassa fever in Guinea, three villages were investigated in high endemic zone, close to Sierra Leone border. Biodiversity of the small mammal community is presented in this study through a standardized trapping in houses, cultivations and forest. Identification of the small mammals was based on morphology and by molecular technique for sibling species. Of the 1123 specimens collected in 2003–2005, we identified seventeen species (thirteen Muridae, four Soricidae), leading to high diversity (Shannon index = 1.6–1.8) and high equitability (evenness index = 0.7–0.8) in cultivations and forest. In houses conversely, the rodent community was dominated by Mastomys natalensis (95–98\%), leading to low diversity and equitability. Dynamics and reproduction were investigated in two species of pygmy mice, Mus mattheyi and Mus minutoides, two species of Praomys, P. daltoni and P. rostratus, and in Mastomys erythroleucus. The pygmy mice were abundant in cultivations in early rainy season, and reproduced from rainy to dry season. Praomys daltoni was also found more abundant in cultivations and seemed to reproduce between rainy and dry season, whereas P. rostratus preferred forest and cultivations in late rainy season, and reproduced throughout the year. Finally, M. erythroleucus was more abundant in forest in dry season, and seemed to reproduce from late rainy to dry season. This species had a low occurrence (6.5\%) in the Faranah’s zone, and probably lived at its southern limit in Guinea. The presence of other Murinae, such as M. natalensis, Praomys spp as possible competitors in the same habitats, is discussed. For the first time, this study relates population biology of pygmy mice with molecular identification.},

Here, the association of {LASV} prevalence with fecundity, fertility, and the age structure of the rodent population was analyzed using data from the previous study. The animals reproduced throughout the year, but highest fecundity was observed during the rainy season. Accordingly, the rodent population was aged at the beginning and young at the end of the rainy season. Lassa virus infection was observed in all age groups, including the very young, which is compatible with vertical transmission. However, since the prevalence of infection showed a trend with increasing age in the younger age groups, horizontal transmission by yet unknown mechanisms may also play a role in {LASV} transmission. Multivariate analysis did not show an association of {LASV} prevalence with any demographic variable studied. Rodent behavior influencing virus transmissibility and contaminated environment may therefore be responsible for spatial and seasonal variations in {LASV} prevalence in M. natalensis.},

	abstract = {Based on empiric surveillance data, the incidence of human Lassa fever ({LF}) cases in Guinea and other West African countries has been reported to increase during the dry season compared to the rainy season. To investigate possible links with the ecology of the rodent reservoir of the virus, we conducted a 2-year longitudinal survey of Mastomys natalensis in a region of high human Lassa virus ({LASV}) seropositivity in Guinea. Standardized rodent trapping with similar trapping efforts between seasons was performed in three villages and 53.5\% (601/1123) of the animals were identified as M. natalensis using morphometric and molecular criteria. Mean trapping success ({TS}) of M. natalensis was always higher inside houses than in proximal cultivations. In the dry season, mean {TS} increased 2-fold inside houses and decreased up to 10-fold outside (p {\textless} 0.0001), suggesting aggregation of rodents inside houses due to restricted food supply. 14.5\% (80/553) of M. natalensis were tested positive for Lassa virus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}; range, 5\%-30\%) and prevalence of the virus was two to three times higher in rodents captured in the rainy season than in the dry season (p {\textless} 0.05). Inside houses, however, the {LASV} prevalence fluctuated nonsignificantly with season. These data suggest that in Guinea the risk of {LASV} transmission from rodents to humans is present both in the rainy and the dry season, reflected by the occurrence of {LF} cases throughout the year. In the dry season, however, the increased risk of humans encountering Mastomys and their excreta inside of houses may result in an increase of human Lassa fever cases.},

To this end, we generated 132 partial nucleoprotein sequences of {LASV} from M. natalensis trapped in 12 villages around Faranah, Upper Guinea, over a period of 12 years. This study reveals two main features of {LASV} evolution in M. natalensis. First, the virus evolves in the reservoir with a molecular clock rate of 9 (7-11) × 10(-4) position(-1) year(-1) implying that contemporary {LASV} lineages circulate in the Faranah area since less than 100 years. Second, viruses circulating in a specific village are diverse and polyphyletic. We observed, however, there are monophyletic clusters at village and sub-village level at specific points in time. In conclusion, our data indicate that the temporal and spatial pattern of {LASV} evolution in the natural reservoir is characterized by a combination of stationary circulation within a village and virus movement between villages. The latter feature is relevant for rodent control strategies, as it implies that recurrence of the virus from neighbouring villages may occur in villages where the virus has previously been eradicated.},

	abstract = {Background Lassa fever is caused by a viral haemorrhagic arenavirus that affects two to three million people in West Africa, causing a mortality of between 5,000 and 10,000 each year. The natural reservoir of Lassa virus is the multi-mammate rat Mastomys natalensis, which lives in houses and surrounding fields. With the aim of gaining more information to control this disease, we here carry out a spatial analysis of Lassa fever data from human cases and infected rodent hosts covering the period 1965–2007. Information on contemporary environmental conditions (temperature, rainfall, vegetation) was derived from {NASA} Terra {MODIS} satellite sensor data and other sources and for elevation from the {GTOPO}30 surface for the region from Senegal to the Congo. All multi-temporal data were analysed using temporal Fourier techniques to generate images of means, amplitudes and phases which were used as the predictor variables in the models. In addition, meteorological rainfall data collected between 1951 and 1989 were used to generate a synoptic rainfall surface for the same region. Methodology/Principal Findings Three different analyses (models) are presented, one superimposing Lassa fever outbreaks on the mean rainfall surface (Model 1) and the other two using non-linear discriminant analytical techniques. Model 2 selected variables in a step-wise inclusive fashion, and Model 3 used an information-theoretic approach in which many different random combinations of 10 variables were fitted to the Lassa fever data. Three combinations of absence∶presence clusters were used in each of Models 2 and 3, the 2 absence∶1 presence cluster combination giving what appeared to be the best result. Model 1 showed that the recorded outbreaks of Lassa fever in human populations occurred in zones receiving between 1,500 and 3,000 mm rainfall annually. Rainfall, and to a much lesser extent temperature variables, were most strongly selected in both Models 2 and 3, and neither vegetation nor altitude seemed particularly important. Both Models 2 and 3 produced mean kappa values in excess of 0.91 (Model 2) or 0.86 (Model 3), making them ‘Excellent’. Conclusion/Significance The Lassa fever areas predicted by the models cover approximately 80\% of each of Sierra Leone and Liberia, 50\% of Guinea, 40\% of Nigeria, 30\% of each of Côte d'Ivoire, Togo and Benin, and 10\% of Ghana.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever ({LF}) is increasingly recognized by global health institutions as an important rodent-borne disease with severe impacts on some of West Africa's poorest communities. However, our knowledge of {LF} ecology, epidemiology and distribution is limited, which presents barriers to both short-term disease forecasting and prediction of long-term impacts of environmental change on Lassa virus ({LASV}) zoonotic transmission dynamics. Here, we synthesize current knowledge to show that extrapolations from past research have produced an incomplete picture of the incidence and distribution of {LF}, with negative consequences for policy planning, medical treatment and management interventions. Although the recent increase in {LF} case reports is likely due to improved surveillance, recent studies suggest that future socio-ecological changes in West Africa may drive increases in {LF} burden. Future research should focus on the geographical distribution and disease burden of {LF}, in order to improve its integration into public policy and disease control strategies.},

	abstract = {Environmental changes have been shown to play an important role in the emergence of new human diseases of zoonotic origin. The contribution of social factors to their spread, especially conflicts followed by mass movement of populations, has not been extensively investigated. Here we reveal the effects of civil war on the phylogeography of a zoonotic emerging infectious disease by concomitantly studying the population structure, evolution and demography of Lassa virus and its natural reservoir, the rodent Mastomys natalensis, in Guinea, West Africa. Analysis of nucleoprotein gene sequences enabled us to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Lassa virus, which appeared 750 to 900 years ago in Nigeria and only recently spread across western Africa (170 years ago). Bayesian demographic inferences revealed that both the host and the virus populations have gone recently through severe genetic bottlenecks. The timing of these events matches civil war-related mass movements of refugees and accompanying environmental degradation. Forest and habitat destruction and human predation of the natural reservoir are likely explanations for the sharp decline observed in the rodent populations, the consequent virus population decline, and the coincident increased incidence of Lassa fever in these regions. Interestingly, we were also able to detect a similar pattern in Nigeria coinciding with the Biafra war. Our findings show that anthropogenic factors may profoundly impact the population genetics of a virus and its reservoir within the context of an emerging infectious disease.},

The highest prevalence of {LVA} (25-55\%) was found among inhabitants of tropical secondary forest (areas near Gueckedou, Yomou, and Lola) and guinea savannah (Faranah and Kindia areas), near the southern frontiers with Sierra Leone and Liberia. A much lower prevalence (4-7\%) was found among inhabitants of mountainous (Pita, Labe, and Mali) and coastal (Boffa, Boké) areas. We found no discernible differences in {LVA} prevalence between males and females or among various age groups. Testing of 406 hospital staff members of the eight central hospitals in these areas for {LVA} revealed a similar distribution of seropositivity among hospitals in various prefectures. The highest prevalence of {LVA} in hospital staff (29-40\%) was in the Gueckedou and Lola hospitals. Sera of {LVA}-positive persons were tested via Western blot analysis.

	abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa virus ({LASV}), an arenavirus that causes Lassa haemorrhagic fever in humans in West Africa. While previous studies suggest that spillover risk is focal within rural villages due to the spatial behaviour of the rodents, the level of clustering was never specifically assessed. Nevertheless, detailed information on the spatial distribution of infected rodents would be highly valuable to optimize {LASV}-control campaigns, which are limited to rodent control or interrupting human–rodent contact considering that a human vaccine is not available. Here, we analysed data from a four-year field experiment to investigate whether {LASV}-infected rodents cluster in households in six rural villages in Guinea. Our analyses were based on the infection status (antibody or {PCR}) and geolocation of rodents (n = 864), and complemented with a phylogenetic analysis of {LASV} sequences (n = 119). We observed that the majority of infected rodents were trapped in a few houses (20\%) and most houses were rodent-free at a specific point in time (60\%). We also found that {LASV} strains circulating in a specific village were polyphyletic with respect to neighbouring villages, although most strains grouped together at the sub-village level and persisted over time. In conclusion, our results suggest that: (i) {LASV} spillover risk is heterogeneously distributed within villages in Guinea; (ii) viral elimination in one particular village is unlikely if rodents are not controlled in neighbouring villages. Such spatial information should be incorporated into eco-epidemiological models that assess the cost-efficiency of {LASV} control strategies.},

For 40 years, the Natal multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis, has been assumed to be the sole host of {LASV}. We found evidence that {LASV} is also hosted by other rodent species: the African wood mouse Hylomyscus pamfi in Nigeria, and the Guinea multimammate mouse Mastomys erythroleucus in both Nigeria and Guinea. Virus strains from these animals were isolated in the {BSL}-4 laboratory and fully sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of viral genes coding for glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, polymerase and matrix protein show that Lassa strains detected in M. erythroleucus belong to lineages {III} and {IV}. The strain from H. pamfi clusters close to lineage I (for S gene) and between {II} \& {III} (for L gene). Discovery of new rodent hosts has implications for {LASV} evolution and its spread into new areas within West Africa.},

We sought to elucidate the diversity and distribution of these animals (including known {LASV} reservoirs) geographically, habitat-wise and seasonally. Our {DNA}-assisted survey detected at least 19 small mammal species amongst 790 specimens. Diversity indices were similar between ecological zones and also between endemic and non-endemic areas for Lassa fever. Mastomys natalensis, the most renowned {LASV} host, was present in eight out of nine localities sampled. We also described the spatial occurrence of other known {LASV} hosts such as M. erythroleucus and Hylomyscus pamfi, including carriers of {LASV}-like arenaviruses such as Mus (Nannomys) spp. The most numerous rodents (Mastomys natalensis, M. erythroleucus, and Praomys daltoni) were captured mainly inside human dwellings. Reproductive activity occurred throughout the year, but led to population peaks for M. natalensis in the dry season and for M. erythroleucus and P. daltoni in the rainy season. Extensive geographic distribution of {LASV} rodent reservoirs, with population peaks in different seasons, shows that the risk of rodent-to-human transmission of {LASV} is greater than currently realized.},

	abstract = {Human infectious diseases are a significant threat to global human health and economies (e.g. Ebola, {SARs}), with the majority of infectious diseases having an animal source (zoonotic). Despite their importance, the lack of a quantitative predictive framework hampers our understanding of how spillovers of zoonotic infectious diseases into the human population will be impacted by global environmental stressors. Here, we create an environmental-mechanistic model for understanding the impact of global change on the probability of zoonotic disease reservoir host–human spillover events. As a case study, we focus on Lassa fever virus ({LAS}). We first quantify the spatial determinants of {LAS} outbreaks, including the phylogeographic distribution of its reservoir host Natal multimammate rat (Mastomys natalensis) ({LAS} host). Secondly, we use these determinants to inform our environmental-mechanistic model to estimate present-day {LAS} spillover events and the predicted impact of climate change, human population growth and land use by 2070. We find phylogeographic evidence to suggest that {LAS} is confined to only one clade of {LAS} host (Western clade Mastomys natalensis) and that the probability of its occurrence was a major determinant of the spatial variation in {LAS} historical outbreaks (69·8\%), along with human population density (20·4\%). Our estimates for present-day {LAS} spillover events from our environmental-mechanistic model were consistent with observed patterns, and we predict an increase in events per year by 2070 from 195 125 to 406 725 within the {LAS} endemic western African region. Of the component drivers, climate change and human population growth are predicted to have the largest effects by increasing landscape suitability for the host and human–host contact rates, while land-use change has only a weak impact on the number of future events. {LAS} spillover events did not respond uniformly to global environmental stressors, and we suggest that understanding the impact of global change on zoonotic infectious disease emergence requires an understanding of how reservoir host species respond to environmental change. Our environmental-mechanistic modelling methodology provides a novel generalizable framework to understand the impact of global change on the spillover of zoonotic diseases.},

In the monkeys, early viral lymphoreticulotropism, hepatotropism, nephrotropism, and viraemia were noted. At the time of death, viral titres in nearly all target organs were associated with necrotic changes: splenic lymphoid necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, myocarditis, arteritis, and hepatocytic regeneration. In convalescent monkeys, organ titres diminished slowly, and viraemia persisted at 28 days. At this time, renal and splenic regeneration was occurring and a new lesion, choriomeningitis, was present., Guinea-pigs infected with Lassa virus developed respiratory insufficiency with pulmonary oedema, alveolar hyaline membranes, myocarditis, and focal calcification of myocardial fibres and hepatocytes. Dying animals contained Lassa virus in virtually every organ tested, whereas survivors at 56 days were free of virus and had high complement-fixing antibody titres., Infection of neonatal Mastomys did not cause any clinical disease or pathological lesions despite the presence of virus in the blood, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, lung, brain, urine, and throat secretions throughout the 74-day study. Infected adult Mastomys also remained normal but had virus in many organs. In one animal, virus persisted until the termination of the study at 103 days. Several animals developed a mild meningoencephalitis. The pattern of infection and virus shedding in M. natalensis is ideal for maintenance of the virus in nature; together with the epidemiological field data this emphasizes the incidental nature of the exposure and infection of man.},

	abstract = {Rodents were trapped in the Benue-Plateau and North-Eastern States of Nigeria where Lassa fever had been reported in previous years. Eight Lassa virus strains were isolated from tissues and blood of rodents identified in the field as being of 3 different species: Mastomys natalensis, Rattus rattus, and Mus minutoides. All the infected rodents were collected in village habitats. These isolations indicate the presence of Lassa virus in wild rodents in Nigeria during periods when no human infections were evident., Prior studies in Sierra Leone have indicated that a single rodent species, M. natalensis, may be the important reservoir host of Lassa virus. Since the present study indicates that other rodent species may be involved as well, the ecology of Lassa virus may be more complicated than was heretofore supposed. In view of the importance of determining the geographic and species range of rodent hosts of Lassa virus, and because of the problems inherent in rodent identification under austere field conditions, it is urgent that further studies be conducted in the same areas of Nigeria to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {Accurate data on the Lassa virus ({LASV}) human case fatality rate ({CFR}) and the prevalence of {LASV} in humans, rodents and other mammals are needed for better planning of actions that will ultimately reduce the burden of {LASV} infection in sub-Saharan Africa. In this systematic review with meta-analysis, we searched {PubMed}, Scopus, Africa Journal Online, and African Index Medicus from 1969 to 2020 to obtain studies that reported enough data to calculate {LASV} infection {CFR} or prevalence. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently. We extracted all measures of current, recent, and past infections with {LASV}. Prevalence and {CFR} estimates were pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis. Factors associated with {CFR}, prevalence, and sources of between-study heterogeneity were determined using subgroup and metaregression analyses. This review was registered with {PROSPERO}, {CRD}42020166465. We initially identified 1,399 records and finally retained 109 reports that contributed to 291 prevalence records from 25 countries. The overall {CFR} was 29.7\% (22.3–37.5) in humans. Pooled prevalence of {LASV} infection was 8.7\% (95\% confidence interval: 6.8–10.8) in humans, 3.2\% (1.9–4.6) in rodents, and 0.7\% (0.0–2.3) in other mammals. Subgroup and metaregression analyses revealed a substantial statistical heterogeneity explained by higher prevalence in tissue organs, in case-control, in hospital outbreak, and surveys, in retrospective studies, in urban and hospital setting, in hospitalized patients, and in West African countries. This study suggests that {LASV} infections is an important cause of death in humans and that {LASV} are common in humans, rodents and other mammals in sub-Saharan Africa. These estimates highlight disparities between sub-regions, and population risk profiles. Western Africa, and specific key populations were identified as having higher {LASV} {CFR} and prevalence, hence, deserving more attention for cost-effective preventive interventions.},

	shorttitle = {Chapter 5 - Lassa Fever},
	abstract = {Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever, caused by an arenavirus discovered in 1969 in Nigeria. Nosocomial outbreaks and high seroprevalences have been recorded in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. After 7–10 days of incubation, humans develop fever, malaise, headache, myalgias and sore throat, although most have no recognized symptoms. Acute cases with diarrhea, edema and bleeding from mucosal surfaces affect 0.5\% of the human population, with death occurring 10–15 days after onset. The disease has two geographically endemic areas separated by 2000 km with little evidence of virus circulation in Benin, Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire and Mali. The reservoir is the multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, a rodent widely distributed in Africa. In West Africa, this species is mainly commensal, with populations fluctuating over time and space in rural localities. They are more abundant inside human habitation during the dry season than during the rainy season, increasing the risk of transmission to humans in the dry season. People living in villages are infected by contact with rodent excreta, or by inhaling viral particles. There is also evidence of human-to-human transmission in rural and urban localities. A human-to-rodent transmission is also discussed in this chapter as a consequence of the virus excretion in human saliva and urine, and the virus surviving outside the host. The genome of Lassa virus is bisegmented, with a small fragment coding for the glycoprotein and the nucleoprotein, and a long segment coding for the polymerase and the matrix protein. Today, 11 strains are completely sequenced, and phylogenies reveal large virus diversity in Nigeria with three lineages, while only one exists in Sierra Leone-Guinea-Liberia. Another lineage from Ghana-Côte d’Ivoire-Mali would be intermediate. The phylogeny reveals that Lassa virus emerged 700–900 years ago in Nigeria and then in Sierra Leone 150–200 years ago. This time scale does not support the co-evolution concept since M. natalensis emerged 2.3 million years ago. Recent findings such as new arenaviruses in other African rodents and in snakes argue preferably toward the host-switching concept. The recent emergence in Sierra Leone, the absence of virus positive Mastomys between the two endemic zones and poor virus diversity in the Mano River area point in the direction of a unique import of Lassa virus from Nigeria to Sierra Leone during the 19th century. The hypothesis of human displacements through the Atlantic slave trade and its abolition in 1807 concludes this chapter.},

	abstract = {Understanding the effects of land-use change on zoonotic disease risk is a pressing global health concern. Here, we compare prevalence of Yersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague, in rodents across two land-use types—agricultural and conserved—in northern Tanzania. Estimated abundance of seropositive rodents nearly doubled in agricultural sites compared with conserved sites. This relationship between land-use type and abundance of seropositive rodents is likely mediated by changes in rodent and flea community composition, particularly via an increase in the abundance of the commensal species, Mastomys natalensis, in agricultural habitats. There was mixed support for rodent species diversity negatively impacting Y. pestis seroprevalence. Together, these results suggest that land-use change could affect the risk of local transmission of plague, and raise critical questions about transmission dynamics at the interface of conserved and agricultural habitats. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding disease ecology in the context of rapidly proceeding landscape change.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}. The influence of the intensity of land use on small mammals in the ecoregion Nama Karoo, Namibia was investigated within the biodiversity programme {BIOTA}. Changes in species diversity and abundance were investigated across a fence separating heavily grazed communal and lightly grazed government owned rangeland. Assessing and monitoring of the small mammal populations were done seasonally from 2001-2003 on each of 2ha plots by using capture-mark-recapture methods. In total, 311 individuals representing nine species were caught within 5760 trap nights. Species richness, total abundance, species diversity and settlement was lower in the over-grazed area. The most abundant species were the Gerbillinae, Gerbillurus vallinus and Tatera leucogaster. T. leu-cogaster did not occur in the overgrazed area. Due to the loss of grass cover, smaller bush diversity, bush encroach-ment and smaller arthropod abundance in the overgrazed area, changes in the small mammal community were most likely caused by the loss of food resources, available dew, disruption of habitat structures, cover and shelter and by increased predation risk. Only the ‘desert ’ species, G. vallinus, was favoured by the degraded land. It is also obvious that the uncontrolled grazing in the communal lands has affected the biodiversity and the regeneration potential, thus leading to land degradation.},

Rodent species recorded include: Lophuromys stanleyi, Hylomyscus stella, Praomys jacksoni, Mastomys natalensis, Lophuromys ansorgei, Lemniscomys striatus, Aethomys hindei, Mus triton, Mus minutoides, Deomys ferrugineus, Gerbilliscus kempi, Rattus rattus, Grammomys kuru, and Hybomys univittatus. Overall, L. stanleyi (23.7\%) was the most dominant species followed by H. stella, P. jacksoni, and M. natalensis. Species richness and evenness was highest in the regenerating forest habitat and least in the intact forest habitat. Rodent abundance was significantly affected by habitat type. The regenerating forest habitat had the highest number of animals, while the lowest numbers were observed in the depleted forest habitat. Species diversity was higher in regenerating forest habitat and lowest in the intact forest. The three habitats appeared distinct in terms of rodent species composition and there was a strong association between the two trapping grids in the same habitat type. All ordination plots showed that different rodent species consistently associated with distinct habitats. Habitat type and seasonal changes influenced rodent composition, relative abundance and habitat association. Composition of rodent community reflected the level of habitat degradation and can be used as a proxy for evaluating the biodiversity of lowland tropical forests.},

We conducted a prospective study to detect L. major in rodents, animals which are described as reservoir of the parasite. Rodents were caught in five city areas from November 2005 to October 2006. Giemsa stained smears were realized from the cutaneous lesions when present after macroscopic examination of external lesions. The spleen of each rodent was sterilely removed and split into 3 parts for microscopic examination of smears, culture on {NNN} media and {PCR}, respectively. A total of 101 rodents belonging to 9 genera were trapped. All the direct examinations and cultures were negative. By using {PCR} of lesions and spleen samples, three animals were found infected by L. major: one out of 24 (4.2\%) Mastomys natalensis; one out of 8 (12.5\%) Taterillus sp. and one out of three Cricetomys gambianus. This is the first detection of L. major in rodent species in Burkina Faso. Further studies are needed to confirm their role as reservoirs of L. major.},

	abstract = {As Lassa fever continues to be a public health challenge in West Africa, it is critical to produce good maps of its risk pattern for use in active surveillance and control intervention. We identified eight spatial features related to the rubber plantation environment and used them as explanatory variables for Lassa fever ({LF}) outbreaks on the Uniroyal Liberian Agricultural Company ({LAC}) rubber plantation environment in Grand Bassa County, Liberia. We computed classical and spatial lag regression models on all spatial features, including proximity of residential camp to rubber tree-edge, main road in the plantation, {LAC} hospital, rice farmland, household refuse dump, human population density, post-harvest storage density of rice and density of rodent deterrent on rice storage. We found significant (p=0.0024) spatial autocorrelation between {LF} cases and the spatial features we have considered. We concluded that the rubber plantation environment influenced Mastomys species' breeding and transmission of Lassa virus along spatial scale to humans. The risk factors identified in this study offered a baseline for more effective surveillance and control of {LF} in the post-civil conflict Liberia. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Relapsing fever is the most frequent bacterial disease in Africa. Four main vector / pathogen complexes are classically recognized, with the louse Pediculus humanus acting as vector for B. recurrentis and the soft ticks Ornithodoros sonrai, O. erraticus and O. moubata acting as vectors for Borrelia crocidurae, B. hispanica and B. duttonii, respectively. Our aim was to investigate the epidemiology of the disease in West, North and Central Africa., {METHODS} {AND} {FINDINGS}: From 2002 to 2012, we conducted field surveys in 17 African countries and in Spain. We investigated the occurrence of Ornithodoros ticks in rodent burrows in 282 study sites. We collected 1,629 small mammals that may act as reservoir for Borrelia infections. Using molecular methods we studied genetic diversity among Ornithodoros ticks and Borrelia infections in ticks and small mammals. Of 9,870 burrows investigated, 1,196 (12.1\%) were inhabited by Ornithodoros ticks. In West Africa, the southern and eastern limits of the vectors and Borrelia infections in ticks and small mammals were 13degreeN and 01degreeE, respectively. Molecular studies revealed the occurrence of nine different Ornithodoros species, including five species new for science, with six of them harboring Borrelia infections. Only B. crocidurae was found in West Africa and three Borrelia species were identified in North Africa: B. crocidurae, B. hispanica, and B. merionesi., {CONCLUSIONS}: Borrelia Spirochetes responsible for relapsing fever in humans are highly prevalent both in Ornithodoros ticks and small mammals in North and West Africa but Ornithodoros ticks seem absent south of 13degreeN and small mammals are not infected in these regions. The number of Ornithodoros species acting as vector of relapsing fever is much higher than previously known.},

Arvicanthis niloticus and Praomys daltoni were also abundant, followed by Mastomys natalensis and Gerbilliscus guineae. Abundances were high at the beginning of the rainy season when reproductive activity was low in all species. At the end of the rainy season, murine rodents were actively involved in reproduction, while gerbilline rodents were at their lowest density. Significant changes in relative abundance among habitats (including human dwellings) were observed between periods in some species, suggesting seasonal trends in habitat preferences. This may help species coexistence in this species-rich rodent community, in an area likely to be submitted to significant habitat alterations in the years to come.},

	abstract = {An understanding of the evolutionary history and dynamics of invasive species is required for the construction of predictive models of future spread and the design of biological management measures. The black rat (Rattus rattus) is a major vertebrate invader with a worldwide distribution. Despite the severe ecological, economic and health impacts of this species, its evolutionary history has been little studied. We carried out extensive specimen sampling in Senegal, West Africa, and used microsatellite markers to describe the pattern and processes of invasion in this large continental area. The genetic data obtained were combined with historical knowledge concerning the presence of this species in Senegal. Data were analysed by a combination of Bayesian clustering and approximate Bayesian computation methods. The invasion pathways closely paralleled the history of human trade routes in Senegal. In several places, we detected the occurrence of multiple introductions from genetically different sources. Long-distance migration between towns and villages was also observed. Our findings suggest that genetic bottlenecks and admixture have played a major role in shaping the genetics of invasive black rats. These two processes may generate genetic novelty and favour rapid evolution along the invasion pathways.},

On the basis of morphological, morphometric and cytogenetic characters, we describe these animals as a new species. The distinguishing characteristics of the new species, with respect to D. melanotis and D. mystacalis from Gabon and Ghana, include the absence of a dorsal stripe and a larger body size. The new species is also smaller in size than D. oreas from Mount Cameroon. The new species has morphological similarities with karyo-typed specimens of D. messorius from Ippy (Central African Republic) and the so-called D. melanotis from La Maboke, Gabon, but has a distinct karyotype. It is close in morphology to D. messorius from the Cameroon lowlands. This is the first time G and C banding were employed for members of the genus Dendromus, and the karyotype of the new species confirms that it may be a sibling species of the D. messorius "complex", for which the distribution and measure of species diversity in west central Africa are far from resolved. The new species occurs in Guinean and Liberian montane savannas of Mount Nimba and in banana and quinine plantations around Mount Ziama, Guinea. It is also known from the Ivory Coast. The presence of this new species highlights the importance of altitude savannas and forests of the Nimba region for conservation.},

This study was carried out to establish the identities of murid rodent populations and to compare their diversity between forest and derived savanna sites within south western Nigeria. Identification of captured specimens was carried out by multivariate statistics of body and skull measurements, and also by analysis of certain discrete characters. Six species were identified: Praomys tullbergi, Hylomyscus stella, Mastomys natalensis, Arvicanthis rufinus, Lemniscomys striatus and Lophuromys sikapusi. Forest sites possessed a higher Shannon's diversity index (1.685) than the derived savanna sites (0.978), containing a higher number of taxa and larger abundance of murid rodents.

A total of 954 animals were caught during bimonthly capture sessions over a two-year period. Positive thick blood smears were recorded in 17.6\% of the 740 rodents and 7.3\% of the 55 musk shrews tested. Variations of prevalence were analyzed in Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys huberti, which represented 62.7\% and 28.3\%, respectively, of the animals captured, and 65.7\% and 27.6\%, respectively, of the animals found infected. Borrelia crocidurae prevalence was significantly different between captures and fluctuated separately for each species. Age-specific prevalence of B. crocidurae showed distinct patterns, decreasing with age from 50\% in younger juveniles to 3\% in older adults for A. niloticus, while increasing with age from 8\% to 23\% for M. huberti. No relationship was observed with animal abundance or with the season of the year for either species. These findings suggest that the diversity of the population dynamics of host-vector-parasite associations in the Sahel region of Senegal may be a key factor for the relative stability of the borreliosis reservoir.},

Although it is confined to West Africa, and has been documented in detail in some well-studied areas, the details of the distribution of risk of Lassa virus infection remain poorly known at the level of the broader region. In this paper, we explored the effects of certainty of diagnosis, oversampling in well-studied region, and error balance on results of mapping exercises. Each of the three factors assessed in this study had clear and consistent influences on model results, overestimating risk in southern, humid zones in West Africa, and underestimating risk in drier and more northern areas. The final, adjusted risk map indicates broad risk areas across much of West Africa. Although risk maps are increasingly easy to develop from disease occurrence data and raster data sets summarizing aspects of environments and landscapes, this process is highly sensitive to issues of data quality, sampling design, and design of analysis, with macrogeographic implications of each of these issues and the potential for misrepresenting real patterns of risk.},

The small mammal fauna of Sierra Leone is poorly documented, although bats and rodents account for the majority of mammalian diversity. Based on morphological, genetic and echolocation data, we recorded 30 bat (Chiroptera), three shrew (Soricomorpha) and eleven rodent (Rodentia) species at the Seli River in the north of the country in 2014 and 2016, during a baseline study for the Bumbuna Phase {II} hydroelectric project. In 2016, 15 bat species were additionally documented at the western fringe of the Loma Mountains, a recently established national park and biodiversity offset for the Bumbuna Phase I dam. Three bat species were recorded for the first time in Sierra Leone, raising the total number for the country to 61. Further, two bat species are threatened and endemic to the Upper Guinean Forest and several taxa of small mammals are poorly known or represent undescribed species. Overall, the habitats of the project area supported a species-rich small mammal fauna including species of global conservation concern. Suitable mitigation measures and/or offsets are necessary to maintain biodiversity and ecosystems in a region that is under high human pressure.},

	abstract = {Hydatigera (Cestoda: Taeniidae) is a recently resurrected genus including species seldom investigated in sub-Saharan Africa. We surveyed wild small mammal populations in the areas of Richard Toll and Lake Guiers, Senegal, with the objective to evaluate their potential role as intermediate hosts of larval taeniid stages (i.e. metacestodes). Based on genetic sequences of a segment of the mitochondrial {DNA} gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 ({COI}), we identified Hydatigera parva metacestodes in 19 out of 172 (11.0\%) Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) and one out of six (16.7\%) gerbils (Taterillus sp.) and Hydatigera taeniaeformis sensu stricto metacestodes in one out of 215 (0.5\%) Nile rats (Arvicanthis niloticus). This study reports epidemiological and molecular information on H. parva and H. taeniaeformis in West African rodents, further supporting the phylogeographic hypothesis on the African origin of H. parva. Our findings may indicate significant trophic interactions contributing to the local transmission of Hydatigera spp. and other parasites with similar life-cycle mechanisms. We therefore propose that further field investigations of rodent population dynamics and rodent-borne infectious organisms are necessary to improve our understanding of host-parasite associations driving the transmission risks of rodent parasites in West Africa.},

	abstract = {Commensal rodent species are key reservoirs for Toxoplasma gondii in the domestic environment. In rodents, different T. gondii strains show variable patterns of virulence according to host species. Toxoplasma gondii strains causing non-lethal chronic infections in local hosts will be more likely to persist in a given environment, but few studies have addressed the possible role of these interactions in shaping the T. gondii population structure. In addition, the absence of validated techniques for upstream detection of T. gondii chronic infection in wild rodents hinders exploration of this issue under natural conditions. In this study, we took advantage of an extensive survey of commensal small mammals in three coastal localities of Senegal, with a species assemblage constituted of both native African species and invasive species. We tested 828 individuals for T. gondii chronic infection using the modified agglutination test for antibody detection in serum samples and a quantitative {PCR} assay for detection of T. gondii {DNA} in brain samples. The infecting T. gondii strains were genotyped whenever possible by the analysis of 15 microsatellite markers. We found (i) a very poor concordance between molecular detection and serology in the invasive house mouse, (ii) significantly different levels of prevalence by species and (iii) the autochthonous T. gondii Africa 1 lineage strains, which are lethal for laboratory mice, only in the native African species of commensal small mammals. Overall, this study highlights the need to reconsider the use of {MAT} serology in natural populations of house mice and provides the first known data about T. gondii genetic diversity in invasive and native species of small mammals from Africa. In light of these results, we discuss the role of invasive and native species, with their variable adaptations to different T. gondii strains, in shaping the spatial structure of T. gondii genetic diversity in Africa.

	abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa virus, an arenavirus that causes Lassa haemorrhagic fever in humans in West Africa. Because no vaccine exists and therapeutic options are limited, preventing infection through rodent control and human behavioural measures is currently considered to be the only option. In order to assess the efficacy of rodent control, we performed a 4-year field experiment in rural Upper Guinea and developed a mathematical model to simulate different control strategies (annual density control, continuous density control, and rodent vaccination). For the field study, rodenticide baits were placed each year in three rural villages, while three other villages were used as controls. Rodents were trapped before and after every treatment and their antibody status and age were determined. Data from the field study were used to parameterize the mathematical model. In the field study, we found a significant negative effect of rodent control on seroprevalence, but this effect was small especially given the effort. Furthermore, the rodent populations recovered rapidly after rodenticide application, leading us to conclude that an annual control strategy is unlikely to significantly reduce Lassa virus spillover to humans. In agreement with this finding, the mathematical model suggests that the use of continuous control or rodent vaccination is the only strategy that could lead to Lassa virus elimination. These field and model results can serve as a guide for determining how long and frequent rodent control should be done in order to eliminate Lassa virus in rural villages.},

Although rodent surveys could help to assess the circulation of T. gondii, they have seldom been set up in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to examine Toxoplasma seroprevalence in rodents from villages and towns across Senegal. Rodents were sampled in 40 localities using a standardised trapping protocol. Detection of T. gondii antibodies was performed on 1205 rodents, using a modified agglutination test ({MAT}) technique. Seroprevalence data were analysed depending on geography, the local rodent community, and individual characteristics of the rodent hosts. We found 44 seropositive rodents from four different species (Mastomys erythroleucus, Mastomys natalensis, Mus musculus domesticus, Rattus rattus). Toxoplasma seroprevalence was low, averaging 4\% in the localities. Higher Toxoplasma seroprevalence (up to 24\%) was found in northern Senegal, a region known to be the heart of pastoral herding in the country. Copyright © C.

We characterized the evolutionary relationships among multiple Schistosoma mansoni isolates collected from snails (intermediate hosts), humans (definitive hosts), and rodents (definitive hosts) in Senegal. On a local scale, diagnosis of S. mansoni infection ranged 3.8\%-44.8\% in school-aged children, 1.7\%-52.6\% in Mastomys huberti mice, and 1.8\%-7.1\% in Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails. Our phylogenetic framework confirmed the presence of multiple S. mansoni lineages that could infect both humans and rodents; divergence times of these lineages varied (0.13-0.02 million years ago). We propose that extensive movement of persons across West Africa might have contributed to the establishment of these various multihost S. mansoni clades. High S. mansoni prevalence in rodents at transmission sites frequented by humans further highlights the implications that alternative hosts could have on future public health interventions.},

	abstract = {Trematodes of the genus Plagiorchis have a wide geographical distribution and can exploit a variety of hosts. The occurrence and zoonotic potential of Plagiorchis spp. have been characterised across several countries in Asia; in contrast, information on Plagiorchis parasites in Africa remains anecdotal. We isolated a previously undescribed Plagiorchis species from the biliary tract and small intestine of 201 out of 427 small mammals collected in the region of Lake Guiers, Senegal, with local prevalence ranging from 38.6\% to 77.0\%. Conversely, Plagiorchis isolates were not observed in the 244 small mammals sampled in and around the town of Richard Toll, Senegal. Molecular phylogenetics of the internal transcribed spacer region, nuclear ribosomal {DNA}, and of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene, mitochondrial {DNA}, supported the monophyly and multi-host spectrum of this newly discovered West African Plagiorchis species. Sequencing of individual cercariae shed by Radix natalensis (Gastropoda: Lymnaeidae) suggested that these freshwater snails may act as suitable first intermediate hosts. Phylogenetic analysis yielded a highly resolved topology indicating two different clades, one composed by Plagiorchis spp. infecting rodents, insectivores, and birds, while the other included parasites of bats. Our findings showed the low host specificity and high prevalence of the isolated Plagiorchis sp. in the Lake Guiers region, with Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) appearing to play a primary role in the epidemiology of this parasite. The results raise concern about the zoonotic potential of Plagiorchis sp. in local communities of the Lake Guiers region, and highlight food-borne trematodiases and their link to land-use change as a neglected public health issue in regions of West Africa.},

	abstract = {Usutu virus ({USUV}) is a Culex-associated mosquito-borne flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family. Since its discovery in 1959, the virus has been isolated from birds, arthropods and humans in Europe and Africa. An increasing number of Usutu virus infections in humans with neurological presentations have been reported. Recently, the virus has been detected in bats and horses, which deviates from the currently proposed enzootic cycle of {USUV} involving several different avian and mosquito species. Despite this increasing number of viral detections in different mammalian hosts, the existence of a non-avian reservoir remains unresolved. In Kedougou, a tropical region in the southeast corner of Senegal, Usutu virus was detected, isolated and sequenced from five asymptomatic small mammals: Two different rodent species and a single species of shrew. Additional molecular characterization and in vivo growth dynamics showed that these rodents/shrew-derived viruses are closely related to the reference strain (accession number: {AF}013412) and are as pathogenic as other characterized strains associated with neurological invasions in human. This is the first evidence of Usutu virus isolation from rodents or shrews. Our findings emphasize the need to consider a closer monitoring of terrestrial small mammals in future active surveillance, public health, and epidemiological efforts in response to {USUV} in both Africa and Europe.},

	abstract = {Background: Lassa fever, killing thousands of people annually, is the most reported viral zoonotic disease in Nigeria. Recently, different rodent species carrying diverse lineages of the Lassa virus ({LASV}) in addition to a novel Mobala-like genetic sequence were detected within the country. Here, screening 906 small mammal specimens from 11 localities for {IgG} antibodies and incorporating previous {PCR} detection data involving the same populations, we further describe arenavirus prevalence across Nigeria in relation to host species and geographical location. Methods: Small mammals were trapped during the period 2011-2015 according to geographical location (endemic and non endemic zones for Lassa fever), season (rainy and dry seasons between 2011 and 2012 for certain localities) and habitat (indoois, peridomestic settings and sylvatic vegetation). identification of animal specimens from genera such as Mastomys and Mus (Nannomys) was assisted by {DNA} sequencing. Small mammals were tested for {LASV} {IgG} antibody using an indirect immunofluorescence assay ({IFA}). Results: Small mammals were infected in both the endemic and non-endemic zones for Lassa fever, with a wider range of species {IgG}-positive (n = 8) than those which had been previously detected to be {PCR}-positive (n = 3). {IgG}-positive species, according to number of infected individuals, were Mastomys natalensis (n = 40), Mastomys erythroleucus (n = 15), Praomys daltoni (n = 6), Mus baoulei (n = 5), Rattus rattus (n = 2), Crocidura spp. (n = 2), Mus minutoides (n = 1) and Praomys misonnei (n = 1). Multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis and M. erythroleucus) were the most ubiquitously infected, with animals testing positive by either {PCR} or {IgG} in 7 out of the 11 localities sampled {IgG} prevalence in M. natalensis ranged from 1\% in Abagboro, 17-36\% in Eguare Egoro, Ekpoma and Ngel Nyaki, up to 52 \% in Mayo Ranewo. Prevalence according to locality, season and age was not, however, statistically significant for M. natalensis in Eguare Egoro and Ekpoma, localities that were sampled longitudinally. Conclusions: Overall, our study demonstrates that arenavirus occurrence is probably more widely distributed geographically and in extent of host taxa than is currently realized. This expanded scope should be taken into consideration in Lassa fever control efforts. further sampling should also be carried out to isolate and characterize potential arenaviruses present in small mammal populations we found to be seropositive.},

	abstract = {Often overshadowed by global trends in urbanization, counter-urbanization is also on the rise worldwide. Left unaddressed, counter-urbanization can result in conditions that imperil human well-being. For example, counter-urbanization is hypothesized to increase the prevalence of ecological hazards like synanthropic pest and pathogen host species by shifting habitat and resource availability. In this study, we addressed this hypothesis by examining whether the abundance or diversity of rodent hosts varies according to the prevalence of abandoned, unmaintained properties across a mosaic of counter-urbanization in post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans (Louisiana, {USA}). We also sought to determine whether management of vacant lots can influence the abundance or diversity of rodents across counter-urbanizing landscapes. Analysis of capture data from multi-year trapping efforts across the greater New Orleans area showed that total rodent abundance was highest in residential areas with high levels of vacancy and unmaintained vegetation as well as low household income and low residency. Greater rodent abundance and richness also occurred in areas with features related to infrastructure loss, such as trash and debris, especially in winter. While these results highlight that property abandonment can augment populations of pest and pathogen host species, our findings also indicate that management of abandoned areas can potentially mitigate public health concerns in counter-urbanizing landscapes.},

Trap success varied between 0.8\% and 14.1\%. Mean corrected trap success was 6.4\%. Data are analyzed in terms of habitat preferences of individual species, community composition and species richness. Results of dietary analysis are presented. The data indicate that the rodent fauna of cocoa groves contains both savanna-derived and forest-derived elements, though some habitat specialist species were absent. Habitats with a high percentage of understory cover showed a higher rodent species diversity and biomass than those with a sparse understory. The habitats contained 43\% of the predicted small mammal fauna, including 33\% of the forest-dwelling species. Missing species were mostly arboreal forms. Cocoa groves may provide important refugia for forestderived small mammal species in areas where deforestation has been extensive.},

	abstract = {Statistical approaches for inferring the spatial distribution of taxa (Species Distribution Models, {SDMs}) commonly rely on available occurrence data, which is often clumped and geographically restricted. Although available {SDM} methods address some of these factors, they could be more directly and accurately modelled using a spatially-explicit approach. Software to fit models with spatial autocorrelation parameters in {SDMs} are now widely available, but whether such approaches for inferring {SDMs} aid predictions compared to other methodologies is unknown. Here, within a simulated environment using 1000 generated species’ ranges, we compared the performance of two commonly used non-spatial {SDM} methods (Maximum Entropy Modelling, {MAXENT} and boosted regression trees, {BRT}), to a spatial Bayesian {SDM} method (fitted using R-{INLA}), when the underlying data exhibit varying combinations of clumping and geographic restriction. Finally, we tested how any recommended methodological settings designed to account for spatially non-random patterns in the data impact inference. Spatial Bayesian {SDM} method was the most consistently accurate method, being in the top 2 most accurate methods in 7 out of 8 data sampling scenarios. Within high-coverage sample datasets, all methods performed fairly similarly. When sampling points were randomly spread, {BRT} had a 1–3\% greater accuracy over the other methods and when samples were clumped, the spatial Bayesian {SDM} method had a 4\%-8\% better {AUC} score. Alternatively, when sampling points were restricted to a small section of the true range all methods were on average 10–12\% less accurate, with greater variation among the methods. Model inference under the recommended settings to account for autocorrelation was not impacted by clumping or restriction of data, except for the complexity of the spatial regression term in the spatial Bayesian model. Methods, such as those made available by R-{INLA}, can be successfully used to account for spatial autocorrelation in an {SDM} context and, by taking account of random effects, produce outputs that can better elucidate the role of covariates in predicting species occurrence. Given that it is often unclear what the drivers are behind data clumping in an empirical occurrence dataset, or indeed how geographically restricted these data are, spatially-explicit Bayesian {SDMs} may be the better choice when modelling the spatial distribution of target species.},

	abstract = {Improving detection probabilities for rare species is critical when assessing presence or habitat associations. Our goal was to create a new small mammal trapping protocol that improved detection of rare species, such as the olive-backed pocket mouse (Perognathus fasciatus). We used three trap and bait types and trapped an area 4.4 times larger than the standard grid. We also assessed the effect of captures of non-target species on detection probability of pocket mice. Regardless of species, trap success was higher for Havaharts. We found that bait and trap type selection varied significantly by species, with pocket mice showing strongest selection for Havahart traps baited with bird seed. Increasing grid size, while maintaining a similar trapping effort, resulted in higher detection probability, although our analyses showed that effective grids can be about three-quarters of the size we use to achieve similar results. We were also able to demonstrate that by deploying a combination of different traps and baits it is possible to overcome the potential effect of non-target species (e.g., deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus) on the detection probability of pocket mice. Our results show that simple changes to standard small-mammal trapping methods can dramatically increase the detectability of rare and elusive small mammals. Increasing detection probability of rare components of a community can improve the results and understanding of future studies.},

The key feature of such problems, which we exploit, is that variation in abundance induces variation in detection probability. Thus, heterogeneity in abundance can be modeled as heterogeneity in detection probability. Moreover, this linkage between heterogeneity in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability allows one to exploit a heterogeneous detection probability model to estimate the underlying distribution of abundances. Therefore, our method allows estimation of abundance from repeated observations of the presence or absence of animals without having to uniquely mark individuals in the population.},

In Asia alone, the rice loss every year caused by rodents could feed about 200 million people. Damage to crops in Africa and South America is equally dramatic. Rodent control often comes too late, is inefficient, or is considered too expensive. Using the multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) in Tanzania and the house mouse (Mus domesticus) in southeastern Australia as primary case studies, we demonstrate how ecology and economics can be combined to identify management strategies to make rodent control work more efficiently than it does today. Three more rodent–pest systems – including two from Asia, the rice-field rat (Rattus argentiventer) and Brandt's vole (Microtus brandti), and one from South America, the leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini) – are presented within the same bio-economic perspective. For all these species, the ability to relate outbreaks to interannual climatic variability creates the potential to assess the economic benefits of forecasting rodent outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Rodent pests are especially problematic in terms of agriculture and public health since they can inflict considerable economic damage associated with their abundance, diversity, generalist feeding habits and high reproductive rates. To quantify rodent pest impacts and identify trends in rodent pest research impacting on small-holder agriculture in the Afro-Malagasy region we did a systematic review of research outputs from 1910 to 2015, by developing an a priori defined set of criteria to allow for replication of the review process. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We reviewed 162 publications, and while rodent pest research was spatially distributed across Africa (32 countries, including Madagascar), there was a disparity in number of studies per country with research biased towards four countries (Tanzania [25\%], Nigeria [9\%], Ethiopia [9\%], Kenya [8\%]) accounting for 51\% of all rodent pest research in the Afro-Malagasy region. There was a disparity in the research themes addressed by Tanzanian publications compared to publications from the rest of the Afro-Malagasy region where research in Tanzania had a much more applied focus (50\%) compared to a more basic research approach (92\%) in the rest of the Afro-Malagasy region. We found that pest rodents have a significant negative effect on the Afro-Malagasy small-holder farming communities. Crop losses varied between cropping stages, storage and crops and the highest losses occurred during early cropping stages (46\% median loss during seedling stage) and the mature stage (15\% median loss). There was a scarcity of studies investigating the effectiveness of various management actions on rodent pest damage and population abundance. Our analysis highlights that there are inadequate empirical studies focused on developing sustainable control methods for rodent pests and rodent pests in the Africa-Malagasy context is generally ignored as a research topic.},

Our models predict reservoir status in this group with over 90\% accuracy, identifying species with high probabilities of harboring undiscovered zoonotic pathogens based on trait profiles that may serve as rules of thumb to distinguish reservoirs from nonreservoir species. Key predictors of zoonotic reservoirs include biogeographical properties, such as range size, as well as intrinsic host traits associated with lifetime reproductive output. Predicted hotspots of novel rodent reservoir diversity occur in the Middle East and Central Asia and the Midwestern United States.},

Here, we describe characteristics of animal reservoirs that are required for pathogen spillover. We assembled and analyzed a database of 330 disease systems in which a pathogen spills over from a reservoir of one or more species. Three-quarters of reservoirs included wildlife, and 84\% included mammals. Further, 65\% of pathogens depended on a community of reservoir hosts, rather than a single species, for persistence. Among mammals, the most frequently identified reservoir hosts were rodents, artiodactyls, and carnivores. The distribution among orders of mammalian species identified as reservoirs did not differ from that expected by chance. Among disease systems with high priority pathogens and epidemic potential, we found birds, primates, and bats to be overrepresented. We also analyzed the life history traits of mammalian reservoir hosts and compared them to mammals as a whole. Reservoir species had faster life history characteristics than mammals overall, exhibiting traits associated with greater reproductive output rather than long-term survival. Thus, we find that in many respects, reservoirs of spillover pathogens are indeed special. The described patterns provide a useful resource for studying and managing emerging infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {The multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis Smith 1834, is a dominant species in agro-ecosystems in Sub-Saharan Africa, but adapts quickly to changes in non-agricultural landscape, particularly woodlands and forests. In this study we report on reproduction and population dynamics of M. natalensis in deforested high elevation localities in the Usambara Mountains, north-east Tanzania. We conducted Capture-Mark-Recapture studies in 2002-2004, and established that reproduction of M. natalensis takes place in the extended wet season between February and June, and the population density peaks in June-August. Reproduction cease in July to January and population density drops from July onwards. Reproduction and population density fluctuations are linked to the duration and amount of rainfall. In years when rainfall was below average and the wet season was short, the population density was significantly lower (below 10 animals/ha and 60 animals/ha in 2003 and 2004 respectively, compared to {\textgreater}100 animals/ha in 2002 when rainfall was above the seasonal average) (Fdf 2,13= 9.092, p {\textless} 0.01 for in between years variations and Fdf 12,15= 5.389, p {\textless} 0.01 for effect of cumulative annual rainfall on population density). These densities were much lower than in the lowland savannah habitats in central and southwest Tanzania. A comparison between the farmland/fallow mosaic fields and agro–forestry areas showed higher population densities in the former, which have similarities to the preferred habitats in the lowland savannahs. The increasing abundance of M. natalensis in the Usambara could have some consequences: M. natalensis is major pest and is involved in the plague cycle in the western Usambara Mountains. Mastomys natalensis is also a strong competitor and the impact on endemic rodent species, e.g. Lophuromys flavopunctatus and Praomys delectorum is unknown.},

	abstract = {West Africa faces an increasing challenge related to water resources in the coming decades; hence high-confidence climate projection is crucial for the region’s future. In this study, future changes in summer monsoon rainfall under the {RCP}8.5 scenario were investigated over West Africa for the period of 2074–2099 with respect to the present-day period of 1980–2005 using the Rossby Centre Regional Climate Model ({RCA}4), driven by six Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 ({CMIP}5) global circulation models ({GCMs}). Through evaluation of the present climate, the {RCA}4 simulations and their multi-model ensemble mean ({EnsMean}) reasonably reproduced the climatology of the summer rainfall and associated tropospheric circulation features. In a warmer climate, summer monsoon rainfall is projected to increase in most parts of West Africa, but a decrease is expected in the northwest, around Senegal. Changes in the monsoon circulation are opposite in the lower and upper troposphere, with the tipping point at 400 {hPa}. Specifically, a projected strengthening and northward shift is observed at the lower and mid-tropospheric level, while weakening is evident at the upper tropospheric level. A diagnosis based on a moisture budget equation reveals that the robust positive response of West African summer monsoon rainfall to global warming is largely explained by the enhancement of moisture convergence and surface evaporation.},

Fifty individuals of nine species of rodents were recorded, with Mastomys erythroleucus (multimammate mouse) being the most abundant. Small mammal species diversity was highest (H’ = 1.88) and lowest (H’ = 0.98) in Tain {II} and Tain I forest reserves, respectively. The presence of some savanna species in some of the reserves indicated high levels of degradation. Fifty-four bird species, representing 22 families, were recorded, with 16 of the species being under national conservation protection. It is recommended that the reserves be zoned into smaller management areas to enable more efficient management, through initiation of reforestation programmes, anti-poaching patrols, research, and long-term monitoring.

Between 2009 and 2013, 108 black rats (Rattus rattus) and 77 mice (Mus musculus) were analysed for the presence of Coxiella and Toxoplasma antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ({ELISA}) and indirect immunofluorescence ({IFA}), respectively. Our results showed a wide distribution of C. burnetii and T. gondii, except for T. gondii in Cape Verde, in both rodent species. The overall seroprevalence of C. burnetii antibodies was 12.4\%; 21.1\% for Cape Verde and 10.2\% for the Canary Islands. With respect to T. gondii, seropositive rodents were only observed in the Canary Islands, with an overall seroprevalence of 15\%. Considering the fact that both pathogens can infect a large range of hosts, including livestock and humans, the results are of public health and veterinary importance and could be used by governmental entities to manage risk factors and to prevent future cases of Q fever and toxoplasmosis.},

In recent years there is an increasing interest in mammalian bartonelloses in general and in rodent bartonelloses in particular. To date, no studies investigating the presence of Bartonella spp. in rodents and ectoparasites from Nigeria were carried out. Methodology/Principal Findings: The aim of the current study was to investigate the presence of Bartonella spp. in commensal rodents and their ectoparasites in Nigeria. We report, for the first time, the molecular detection of Bartonella in 26\% (46/177) of commensal rodents (Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus and Cricetomys gambianus) and 28\% (9/32) of ectoparasite pools (Xenopsylla cheopis, Haemolaelaps spp., Ctenophthalmus spp., Hemimerus talpoides, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus) from Nigeria. Sequence analysis of the citrate synthase gene ({gltA}) revealed diversity of Bartonella spp. and genotypes in Nigerian rodents and their ectoparasites. Bartonella spp. identical or closely related to Bartonella elizabethae, Bartonella tribocorum and Bartonella grahamii were detected. Conclusions/Significance: High prevalence of infection with Bartonella spp. was detected in commensal rodents and ectoparasites from Nigeria. The Bartonella spp. identified were previously associated with human diseases highlighting their importance to public health. Further studies need to be conducted to determine whether the identified Bartonella species could be responsible for human cases of febrile illness in Nigeria.},

The abundance and diversity of small mammal communities were investigated in human-influenced savannahs in close proximity to Niokolo Koba National Park ({NKNP}) in south-eastern Senegal and compared with those from {NKNP}. Two localities were sampled in natural and two in human-influenced areas during two dry and two rainy seasons. Total sampling effort was 5400 trap-nights. Ninety-eight individuals of eleven species were captured outside {NKNP}, while only 28 individuals of five rodent species were caught inside the park (all of which were found also outside {NKNP}). The most abundant species outside {NKNP} was Mastomys erythroleucus, while inside {NKNP} it was Praomys daltoni. Both relative abundance and diversity were significantly higher in human-influenced landscape than in natural savannahs of {NKNP}. The difference in species richness may be linked with lower population densities of certain species in {NKNP} and the effect of traditional agriculture, which may support the presence of species typical for deforested landscape. Furthermore, food availability, and predator abundances are discussed as possible reasons for the higher rodent abundances outside {NKNP}.},

It is a deadly rodent-borne zoonosis with outbreaks occurring mostly in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria, in West Africa. In Sierra Leone, surveillance activities of {LASV} focus mainly on the Kenema area in the eastern region, known to be the epicentre. Little is known about the presence of the virus in the Bo area, where Mastomys natalensis and Rattus rattus share habitats with humans. Our study investigated the circulation and phylogeny of new {LASV} strains and virus seroprevalence in rodent populations of villages in Bo district. Information provided here will be of great importance in prioritizing areas for Lassa fever surveillance and preventive measures to mitigate future outbreaks. Our rodent longitudinal survey carried out over two years (2014-2016) identified Mastomys natalensis as the most prevalent species. While seropositive small mammals were found in every village, the four Mastomys natalensis rodents that tested {PCR}-positive for Lassa virus were found in only two villages. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these sequences belong to the Sierra Leonean clade, within lineage {IV}. In conclusion, {LASV} is present, with low circulation, in small mammals in rural settings around Bo. Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus {LASV}, which was first isolated in the rodent Mastomys natalensis in 1974 in Kenema, Sierra Leone. As little is known about the abundance and the presence of {LASV} in rodents living in the Bo area, we carried out a small mammal longitudinal population survey. A standardized trapping session was performed in various habitats and seasons in six villages over two years (2014-2016) and samples collected were tested for arenavirus {IgG} and {LASV}. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed on sequences identified by {PCR}. A total of 1490 small mammals were collected, and 16 rodent species were identified, with M. natalensis (355, 24\%) found to be the most prevalent species. Forty-one (2.8\%) samples were {IgG} positive, and 31 of these were trapped in homes and 10 in surrounding vegetation. Twenty-nine of 41 seropositive rodents were M. natalensis. We detected four {LASV} by {PCR} in two villages, all found in M. natalensis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences were distributed within the Sierra Leonean clade within lineage {IV}, distinguishing a Bo sub-clade older than a Kenema sub-clade. Compared to other settings, we found a low abundance of M. natalensis and a low circulation of {LASV} in rodents in villages around Bo district.},

	abstract = {The small mammal fauna of a forest area in southern Nigeria is studied in order to understand the general patterns regulating the community composition. A set of different methods of trapping was used in order to evaluate the composition of the species at the level of both the ground-dwelling and the arboreal guilds. For the Insectivora, six shrew species were trapped, but only two (Crocidura nigeriae and C. poensis) appeared abundant and widespread in the various habitat types. No arboreal species were found. For the rodents, 17 species were captured, which were arranged by a Principal Component Analysis into four groups: (1) Rattus rattus and Anomalurus derbianus; (2) Xerus erythropus and Grammomys rutilans; (3) Graphiurus cf. murinus and Hylomyscus stella; (4) the remaining, more generalist species. For the ground-dwelling rodents, 14 species were found, which were arranged in three groups: (1) Malacomys edwardsi and Grammomys sp.; (2) Mylomys dybowskii and Rattus norvegicus; (3) all the other species, with stronger similarities between Praomys tullbergi, Mus musculoides, Aethomys sp. (unknown), and Lemniscomys striatus. Although an approximately equal number of species constituted the arboreal and grounddwelling rodent fauna, the number of trapped animals was much higher on the ground than at the level of the arboreal guild (ratio 8.7: 1; total n = 2322). The general implications of the patterns observed are discussed.},

Composition of bat species clearly reﬂects a forest assemblage, with no savanna species being observed. Two rarely recorded bat species (Hypsugo [crassulus] bellieri and Pipistrellus aﬀ. grandidieri) are reported for the ﬁrst time for Ghana, raising the total number of species for this country to 86. Together with specimens from ﬁve localities in West Africa, Pipistrellus aﬀ. grandidieri from Atewa might represent an undescribed species. Hypsugo (crassulus) bellieri is endemic to the Upper Guinean forests. Zenker’s fruit bat Scotonycteris zenkeri is ranked on the Red List as Near Threatened ({IUCN} 2006). The three terrestrial small mammal species recorded during the survey are likewise forest-dependent and include two West African endemics: Edward’s swamp rat Malacomys edwardsi and the shrew Crocidura grandiceps. The latter is ranked as Near Threatened on the {IUCN} Red List and had not been recorded from Ghana since its description. The overall species composition of small mammals indicates high habitat integrity of the Atewa Range Forest Reserve, which constitutes the most signiﬁcant block of Upland Evergreen Forest in Ghana. The integral protection of Atewa is an outstanding priority for the preservation of (sub-) montane forests in West Africa, both for the conservation of small mammals and of biodiversity in general. In accordance with international conservation principles on mining and biodiversity (Dudley and Stolton 2002, Miranda et al. 2005), we recommend that exploration concessions for Atewa are cancelled, that its legal protection status is upgraded, that no development is allowed within the forest reserve, and that eﬀective management measures are implemented.},

The presence of two species of murids (M. huberti and Arvicanthis niloticus) in this presaharian environment is made possible by the presence of small patches of green vegetation associated with localized fresh water inputs. The contradiction of results from the sampling methods indicate potential biases in the determination of community composition and relative species abundance.

Prevalence reached 12.9\% on average, but showed very important variations in both space and time, thus pointing toward a role of local processes in the maintenance and circulation of rodent-borne leptospires in the area. Prevalence peaks may occur during or one month after moderate (100–200 mm) monthly rainfall, suggesting that rodent-borne leptospires may be more prevalent when standing waters are present, but not at their highest levels (i.e., floods). However, this pattern will have to be confirmed through proper diachronic analysis. Finally, an incomplete but significant host-specificity was observed, with L. kirschneri retrieved only in African shrews, and the invasive Rattus norvegicus and the native Mastomys natalensis preferentially infected by L. interrogans and L. borgpeterseni, respectively.

              The Upper Guinea rainforest zone in West Africa is considered a biodiversity hotspot and contains important habitats for threatened and endemic mammals, yet this region remains poorly known particularly for small mammals. The aim of this study was to survey small mammals in a Liberian and Guinean cross-border conservation area, the Ziama-Wonegizi-Wologizi landscape. We recorded a total of 52 small mammal species, including 26 bats, 15 rodents, 10 shrews, one otter-shrew, of which one rodent species was new to science (
              Colomys
              sp. nov.). We also documented the first country records of the bats
              Chaerephon aloysiisabaudiae

              Pseudoromicia brunnea

              and
              Crocidura grandiceps

              Nycticeinops
              happoldorum

              Micropotamogale lamottei
              at Wologizi, which represents the fourth known locality for this globally threatened species. Finally, the forests of Wologizi and Ziama support numerous threatened species. The results of our survey demonstrate the importance of this region for small mammals and support the creation of a transboundary protected area that will encompass the entire forest landscape.},

            Population genetic approaches may be used to investigate dispersal patterns of species living in highly urbanized environment in order to improve management strategies for biodiversity conservation or pest control. However, in such environment, population genetic structure may reflect both current features of the cityscape and urbanization history. This can be especially relevant when focusing on exotic commensal rodents that have been introduced in numerous primary colonial European settlements. Accounting for spatial and temporal cityscape heterogeneity to determine how past and recent demographic events may interplay to shape current population genetic structure of synanthropic rodents may provide useful insights to manage their populations. In this study, we addressed these issues by focusing on the house mouse,
            Mus musculus domesticus
            , in Dakar, Senegal, where the species may have been introduced as soon as Europeans settled in the middle of the nineteenth century. We examined genetic variation at one mitochondrial locus and 15 nuclear microsatellite markers from individuals sampled in 14 sampling sites representing different stages of urbanization history and different socio-economic environments in Dakar. We used various approaches, including model-based genetic clustering and model-free smoothing of pairwise genetic estimates. We further linked observed spatial genetic patterns to historical and current features of Dakar cityscape using random forest and Bayesian conditional autoregressive models. Results are consistent with an introduction of the house mouse at colonial time and the current genetic structure exhibits a gradient-like pattern reflecting the historical process of spatially continuous expansion of the city from the first European settlement. The genetic patterns further suggest that population dynamics of the house mouse is also driven by the spatial heterogeneity of the current cityscape, including socio-economics features, that translate in habitat quality. Our results highlight the potential importance of accounting for past demographic events to understand spatial genetic patterns of nonnative invasive commensal rodents in highly urbanized environment.},

	abstract = {Gerbillus nigeriae is a sand-dwelling and semi-arid adapted rodent species restricted to the West African Sahel where it causes extensive damages to cereal crops such as millet and sorghum. It also displays one of the most extensive floating chromosomal polymorphisms currently known in mammals, showing a non-random spatial distribution of diploid numbers (2N). We combined population dynamics and genetics to determine dispersal and mobility parameters of G. nigeriae in the species distribution range characterized by low 2N. To do so, we performed a three-year long population survey at Gangara, in the central east Niger. We used both time-dependent monitoring trough capture-mark-recapture ({CMR}) methods and genetic analyses performed on the 134 monitored individuals. {CMR} results showed low to very low population densities (maximum 27.5 individuals/ha) throughout the study. Abundance cycle was single-phased and strongly dependent on rainfall patterns. Mobility parameters showed very low individual mobility, with means of distance between successive (re) captures ({DRS}) and maximal distance between (re) captures ({DMR}) of 7.8 and 14.4 meters, respectively. Genetic analyses revealed significant isolation by distance as well as spatial structuration, thus confirming poor dispersal capacity. Our results are discussed in terms of rodent pest control in arid areas of Niger where cereal crops production is crucial for human food security.},

Conventional live-trapped methods using mainly pitfalls and Sherman traps were used to investigate terrestrial small mammals. The combination of these two methods allowed the capture of 76 specimens belonging to 11 species. The most frequent species was Crocidura jouvenetae (39.47 \%) followed by Hylomyscus simus (14.47 \%) and Hybomys planifrons (10.53 \%). Small mammal communities were globally dominated by forest species (Crocidura eburnea, Crocidura jouvenetae, Crocidura muricauda, Crocidura obscurior, Dephomys defua, Hybomys planifrons, Hylomyscus simus and Mus setulosus), which indicates the lower level of forest degradation at this area. These species of rodent and shrew are threatened to disappear due to the conversion of their habitats to palm oil plantations. It is highly recommended that the company preserve intact primary forest relics within oil palm plantations in order to conserve representative sample local biodiversity.},

This study documents the richness, abundance, diversity, distribution and conservation status of small mammals at the {UGBG}. The methodology involved live-trapping using Sherman live-traps. Overall, 39 individuals belonging to three mammalian orders (Rodentia, Soricomorpha and Erinaceomorpha) and seven species, comprising of four rodents, two shrews and one hedgehog were recorded in 1,080 trap-nights. Overall trapping success and species diversity (Shannon-Wiener H’ and Simpson’s 1-D) indices were therefore 3.61\%, 1.59 and 0.76, respectively. Species richness and diversity were highest (four species; Hʹ = 1.33, 1-D = 0.72) in shrubland and lowest (two species; Hʹ = 0.48, 1-D = 0.3) in grassland. Overlaps of species among the study sites were low, with C. olivieri being the only species common to all sites. Crocidura olivieri was the most abundant species (41.2\%) in the forest, whereas M. erythroleucus dominated (81.3\%) in the grassland. Arvicanthis niloticus solatus and C. oliviera were equally abundant in shrubland. Arvicanthis n. solatus, P. daltoni, C. oliviera, C. foxi and A. albiventris are first records for the Accra Plains. These records add to the species list for the Accra Plains, and highlight the importance of the {UGBG} to small mammal zoogeography and conservation in Ghana.},

	abstract = {The endemicity of Buruli ulcer ({BU}), a non-tuberculous mycobacteria infection, has significantly increased in Côte d'Ivoire. The exact transmission mode remains unknown but {DNA} based evidence of Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent, have implicated potential environmental reservoirs, similar to those suspected in the transmission to humans. The role of small mammals in transmission has recently received some research attention. Based on the hypothesis that the overlapping ecology of human and animal habitats would favour mycobacteria transmission, the study aimed to identify {BU} like infections in small mammals living in close proximity to humans, in endemic communities. One hundred and eleven animals were trapped within five communities in two major endemic areas, Daloa and Tabbo. Majority of trapped small mammals were mice, Mastomys natalensis, of which 8 animals had external lesions. {PCR} on organ and lesion samples identified, predominantly, mycobacterium spp, of which five mice were positive for {IS}2404. {IS}2404 sequencing confirmed infection in two mice as M. ulcerans strain Agy99. Our findings suggest that small terrestrial mammals could be susceptible to mycobacteria, particularly, M. ulcerans, within endemic communities in Côte d’Ivoire. It also consolidates earlier evidence asserting their role as potential environmental reservoirs of M. ulcerans in endemic communities. The potential public health threat from these small mammals warrants an “{OneHealth}” approach to investigating the ecology and transmission of M. ulcerans in endemic countries.},

A total of 182 bats of 22 species was captured, representing 37\% of the bat species known to occur in Liberia. Species richness was highest at Gola and Grebo National Forests, possibly because secondary forest and forest edge was sampled there. North Lorma National Forest, where only forest interior was surveyed, had both the lowest capture success and the lowest species richness. Three {IUCN} Red List species were recorded: Rhinolophus hillorum (Vulnerable) in Gola National Forest, Scotonycteris zenkeri (Near Threatened) in Grebo National Forest, and Hipposideros fuliginosus (Near Threatened) in North Lorma National Forest. Bat assemblages in each of the surveyed areas were characterized by forestdependent species. Not a single species typical of savanna habitats was recorded, indicating high habitat integrity of the National Forests. Three species are reported for the first time from Liberia (Rhinolophus landeri, Neoromicia guineensis, Neoromicia aff. grandidieri), raising the species total for the country to 59. An updated checklist with corrected species identifications is presented for the bats of Liberia. Two species of shrews, one murid rodent, five squirrels and one anomalure (scaly-tailed squirrel) were also recorded, including the rarely reported Western Palm Squirrel Epixerus ebii and the Lesser Anomalure Anomalurus cf. pusillus.},

A total of 128 specimens belonging to at least 18 species were recorded including ﬁve species of rodent, six species of shrew and seven bat species. Within Ajenjua Bepo, six shrew species were recorded including four forest species. Despite the high degree of disturbance of the secondary forest, three specimens of Crocidura muricauda were collected. Only three species of murid rodents were collected, with two forest species (Malacomys edwardi and Praomys tullbergi). Six pteropodid bat species and a single insectivorous bat species were recorded. Several of these species were forest-dwelling species. Within the Mamang River Forest Reserve, ﬁve or six shrew species were collected, the dominant species being the forest-dwelling Crocidura obscurior. With a similar trapping eﬀort as at Site 1, a higher number of specimens (39) and species (5) of rodents were recorded within Mamang River. The forest-dwelling Praomys tullbergi was dominant. Only four specimens of a single forest-dwelling bat species (Myonycteris torquata) were recorded within the forest, most likely a result of weather conditions during surveys. Both species richness and species abundance of the forest shrew and murid rodent species point to a higher conservation potential of Mamang River than Ajenjua Bepo. Mamang River appears to present better conservation value due to 1) its larger size, 2) the absence of plantations within Mamang, and 3) the more structured arboreal vegetation within Mamang probably providing more fruit and leaf litter.},

	abstract = {Although several studies have associated Mycobacterium ulcerans ({MU}) infection, Buruli ulcer ({BU}), with slow moving water bodies, there is still no definite mode of transmission. Ecological and transmission studies suggest Variable Number Tandem Repeat ({VNTR}) typing as a useful tool to differentiate {MU} strains from other Mycolactone Producing Mycobacteria ({MPM}). Deciphering the genetic relatedness of clinical and environmental isolates is seminal to determining reservoirs, vectors and transmission routes. In this study, we attempted to source-track {MU} infections to specific water bodies by matching {VNTR} profiles of {MU} in human samples to those in the environment. Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four {BU} endemic communities in the Ashanti region, Ghana. Four {VNTR} loci in {MU} Agy99 genome, were used to genotype environmental {MU} ecovars, and those from 14 confirmed {BU} patients within the same study area. Length polymorphism was confirmed with sequencing. {MU} was present in the 3 different types of water bodies, but significantly higher in biofilm samples. Four {MU} genotypes, designated W, X, Y and Z, were typed in both human and environmental samples. Other reported genotypes were only found in water bodies. Animal trapping identified 1 mouse with lesion characteristic of {BU}, which was confirmed as {MU} infection. Our findings suggest that patients may have been infected from community associated water bodies. Further, we present evidence that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to {MU} infections. M. ulcerans transmission could involve several routes where humans have contact with risk environments, which may be further compounded by water bodies acting as vehicles for disseminating strains.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate dynamics and reproduction in Mastomys erythroleucus inhabiting a high rainfall area in coastal Guinea, West Africa, a small mammal study was carried out through a 1-year longitudinal survey. Sampling was by standardized trapping in houses, cultivations, forest and savanna. Identification of the small mammals was based on morphology, and by molecular technique for sibling species. As a part of a larger survey on reservoirs of Lassa virus in Guinea, 106/289 specimens were screened for arenavirus and were found negative. The most abundant species was M. erythroleucus (46\%) which occurred in all habitats, with a preference for savanna close to the cultivations. Its reproduction was seasonal and lasted for 8 months, beginning in the early rainy season and finishing in the early dry season. It was syntopic with Lophuromys sikapusi (13\%) and Praomys rostratus (10\%), which probably migrated from forest/orchards to cultivations in the late rainy season. Reproduction was high in many species in the late rainy season, but P. rostratus seemed to reproduce actively in the dry season, in contrast to L. sikapusi. Pygmy mice, Mus (Nannomys) spp., were abundant in the early rainy season only. The high species richness (14) is explained by the combined influence of Sudanian-Guinean-Congolian habitats. The role of the absence of bush fires is also debated in that context.},

	abstract = {Description of the subject. Rodents may be major pests to crops and stored food, thus threatening food security. Among them, invasive species such as rats and mice are of particular concern since they are disseminated globally following international trade. We investigated the small mammal assemblage within the international seaport of Cotonou, Benin, in order to determine the relative importance and distribution of native vs invasive rodent species, as well as to evaluate the amount and associated costs of rodent-induced damages on imported 'exported stored goods (here, rice). Objectives. Description of rodent assemblages within an African seaport, and evaluation of the associated damages on stored food stocks. Method. Rodent communities were described following trapping results while associated damages and costs were evaluated following a 25 days-long monitoring campaign and subsequent economic estimation of loss. Results. Our results show that invasive mice and rats are, from far, the most impacting rodents in the storage warehouses, and that the associated economic losses are quite large. Moreover, we point towards a few environmental management procedures that may greatly reduce the impact of rodents on stored goods. Conclusions. Damages and costs due to invasive rodents within the Cotonou Harbor are so that they justify financial investment in rodent population control.},

Small mammals were used because they are relatively easy to survey and serve as bio-indicators that provide knowledge on the state of health of the habitat in which they inhabit. The University of Ghana Campus, Legon ({UGCL}) was divided into two sites: built-up area and the botanical garden, which is less developed. The small mammals were live-trapped using Sherman traps in May 2009 for seven nights by means of transect in the two study sites, using a mixture of peanut butter and corn meal as the preferred bait. The 350 trap-nights yielded 68 captures of five species of small mammals. They were (i) Pygmy mouse (Mus musculoides), (ii) Unstriped grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus), (iii) Tullberg's soft-furred rat (Praomys tullbergi), (iv) African giant shrew (Crocidura olivieri) and (v) White-bellied hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris). Small mammal diversity and abundance were similar between the two sites. This may be due to the comparatively large size and the presence of green areas in the built-up area. The preference of C. olivieri for human-interfered habitats may be used to monitor further habitat modification through real estate development in {UGCL}.},

	abstract = {In this study, the impact of habitat characteristics on the abundance and relative distribution of wild black rats (Rattus rattus) as influenced by human activities was investigated in Yenagoa and its environs in Bayelsa state of Nigeria. Consequently three ecological zones namely: 1.zone of stable urban centre, 2.zone of rapid urban transformation, and 3.zone of undisturbed rural centre were mapped out with three ecological subsets from each zone. These subsets include; site A-undisturbed landscape area, site B-stable human settlement area and site C-refuse dump site area. Standard trapping procedures were then adopted using bread and raw cassava as baits. A total of 1411 black rats were caught in 1002 trap nights representing a mean trap success of 46.9\%. The relative abundance of rats caught were highest in zone 2 with 46.4\% and lowest in zone 1 with 11.9\%. An analysis of variance indicated that there was a significant difference in the abundance of rats in the various study zones( Fcal = 1.626, {MSE} = 21168.11, p{\textless}0.05). A Post Hoc analysis also shows a significant difference on the influence of site structure on black rat population. It is therefore worthwhile to conclude that black rat can be used as bioindicator to monitor the ecosystem health in an environment of growing human population.},

Altogether 1458 rats (56.5 \% ma/es and 43.5 \% females) were trapped and examined for helminths. A total of 1098 rats (55.7 \% ma/es and 44.3\% females) harboured helminth parasites thus providing and overall prevalence of 75.3\% and a mean worn burden 01.3. The between-sex difference was statistically significant =2.64, P {\textless} 0.05) with more ma/es (53.2 \%) than females (46.8 \%) harbouring helminth parasites. There was no marked variation in the infection pattern in the rat host from the different habitats, but the parasite prevalence and distribution appeared to be season-dependent. Parasites (n = 1469) recovered were of 3 helminth groups (nematodes 72.4\%, cestodes 27,5\%, and trematodes 0.6\%). Six nematode species identified were Nippostrongylus braziliensis (19.8\%), Aspicularis tetraptera (17.5\%), Syphacia muris 17,0 \%), Angiostrongy/us cantonensis 16.9\%), Strongy/oides ratti (16.0\%) and Capi//aria hepatica (12,8\%). Also recovered from their rat hosts were the following six cestode species; Hymenolepis diminuta (22,7\%), Taenia taeniaeformis (17.4\%), T. muris (17.1 \%), T. hydatigera (16.6\%), H. nana (16.4\%) and Raillietina muris (9.8\%), Trematodes (n=9) belonging to 3 species, Plagiochis muris, Platynosomoides muris and Corrigia muris were also recovered from five infected rats. A total of 103 rat hosts harboured single infections of nematodes, 818 (98.9\%) had combined nematode/cestode infections, 5 (6.0\%) haboured a combination of nematode/trematode whereas 4 (0.5\%) showed concurrent cestode/trematode infections The influence of seasonal fluctuations on the parasite-host relationship, life cycle patterns of the parasites and immunological potentials of the rat hosts are discussed.},

Twenty five R. rattus (16 and 9) captured within {AEL} and 15 (9 and 6) (control) caught from Iyano Ipaja (10 km away from {AEL}) were examined for bone marrow micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes ({MNPCE}) and polychromatic erythrocytes/normochromatic erythrocytes ({PCE}/{NCE}) ratio, abnormal sperm morphology, alterations in hematological indices and erythrocyte morphology, and histopathology of the viscera using standard protocols. There was significant (p {\textless} 0.05) increase in {MNPCE} but decrease {PCE}/{NCE} ratio in bone marrow cells of exposed rats than the reference site. {MNPCE} was insignificantly higher in male than females. Cauda epididymal sperms from exposed rats showed significant high frequency of teratozoospermia. Erythrocyte count, hemoglobin concentrations, percentage hematocrits, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations, leucocyte count, and lymphocytes decreased while mean corpuscular volume, neutrophils, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin increased in the exposed rats compared to the control. Also, abnormal erythrocyte morphology: acanthocytes, codocytes (target cells), schizocytes, and tear drops significantly increased in the exposed rats. Marginal sexual dimorphism was observed between males and females in the incidence of hematological indices. Histopathological lesions including interstitial edema, hemorrhage, lymphoid depletion, cellular infiltrations, proliferation of the alveolar pneumocytes, necrosis, tissue degeneration, and reduced germinal epithelium were observed in the testes, liver, lungs, heart, kidney, and spleen from the exposed rats compared to the control. Some physicochemicals and metals analyzed in leachates from the landfill are capable of inducing genome instability and systemic toxicity in the exposed rats. Rattus rattus exposed to hazardous chemicals from {AEL} harbored somatic and germ cell mutations, and tissue damage compared to the control rats. We suggest that R. rattus are useful sentinel for genotoxicity and system toxicity assessment of landfill-polluted sites.Graphical abstract.},

	abstract = {Hemoglobin electrophoresis patterns were found to be reliable markers for distinguishing two species of Mastomys in Sierra Leone having 32 and 38 chromosomes. All 32-chromosome animals exhibited a single hemoglobin pattern, whereas those with 38-chromosomes had four distinguishable patterns. Both karyotypes were present throughout Sierra Leone. The 38-chromosome species was more prevalent in the Guinea savanna zone to the north, while the 32-chromosome species was most dominant in human-modified high forest areas of the eastern and southern parts of the country. In almost all situations the 32-chromosome species was more common in houses than in bush habitats; the reverse was true for Mastomys having 38 chromosomes. Analysis of hemoglobin patterns thus becomes useful for species identification, and is necessary to understand the roles of the different Mastomys forms as reservoirs of human diseases, such as Lassa fever in West Africa.},

All positive sera except one reacted against a single serovar. Eight isolates were obtained from field rats: five were serovar australis, one ballum and two unidentified. Five isolates were recovered from 74 bovine kidneys examined: one was serovar pyrogenes and four unidentified. One unidentified isolate failed to react with any of the 16 screening leptospira antisera and another was tentatively considered to be serovar ballum. Two isolates, one ballum and one unidentified, were recovered from the Kubani stream waters. No leptospira was isolated from piggery sewage effluents collected at Kano and Kaduna. It is suggested that serovar ballum be included in any screening battery for leptospirosis in man and animals in Nigeria.},

Using molecular tools, we assessed the prevalence of bacteria and protozoans in small mammals and their ectoparasites in Faladje, Bougouni, and Bamako, Mali. A total of 130 small mammals belonging to 10 different species were captured, of which 74 (56.9\%) were infested by ectoparasites, including Laelaps echidnina, Xenopsylla cheopis, Amblyomma variegatum, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, and Haemaphysalis spp. nymphs. {DNA} of Bartonella was found in 14/75 (18.7\%), 6/48 (12.5\%), and 3/7 (42.8\%) small mammals from Faladje, Bougouni, and Bamako, respectively. In Faladje, Bartonella {DNA} was detected in 31/68 (45.6\%) of L. echidnina and 14/22 (63.6\%) of X. cheopis. In Bougouni, it was found in 2/26 (7.7\%) of L. echidnina and 10/42 (23.8\%) of X. cheopis. The sequences of Bartonella obtained from small mammals were close to those of Bartonella mastomydis, Bartonella elizabethae, and uncultured Bartonella spp. In Faladje, Coxiella burnetii {DNA} was detected in 64.4\% (29/45) of Haemaphysalis spp. ticks, 4.5\% (2/44) of Mastomys erythroleucus, 12.5\% (1/8) of Praomys daltoni, and 1.5\% (1/68) of L. echidnina. We found {DNA} of Wolbachia in X. cheopis from Faladje and {DNA} of Rickettsia africae and Ehrlichia ruminantium in Am. variegatum from Bougouni. The results of our study show that several small mammal species harbor and may serve as potential reservoirs of Bartonella spp., likely to play a major role in the maintenance, circulation, and potential transmission of bacteria in Mali. The pathogenicity of these bacteria for humans or animals remains to be demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Coastal wetlands in Ghana are under severe threat of anthropogenic drivers of habitat degradation and climate change, thereby increasing the need for assessment and monitoring to inform targeted and effective conservation of these ecosystems. Here, we assess small mammal species richness, relative abundance and body mass in three habitats at the Muni-Pomadze Ramsar site of Ghana, and compare these to baseline data gathered in 1997 to evaluate changes in the wetland ecosystem. Small mammals were live-trapped using Sherman collapsible and pitfall traps. We recorded 84 individuals of 10 species in 1485 trap-nights, whereas the baseline study recorded 45 individuals of seven species in 986 trap-nights. The overall trap-success was therefore greater in the present study (5.66 \%) than the baseline study (4.56 \%). The species richness increased from one to four in the forest, and from zero to eight in the thicket, but decreased from six to four in the grassland. The total number of individuals increased in all habitats, with the dominant species in the grassland shifting from Lemniscomys striatus to Mastomys erythroleucus. Three species, Malacomys edwardsi, Grammomys poensis and Praomys tullbergi are the first records for the Muni-Pomadze Ramsar site. Generally, the average body mass of individual species in the grassland was lower in the present study. The considerable changes in small mammal community structure suggest changes in the wetland ecosystem. The conservation implications of our findings are discussed.},

Four localities were sampled, and in each locality, three habitats were surveyed: dense forest, open forest or woodland savannah and shrub savannah. This is the first comprehensive inventory for small mammals in central Benin. We captured 794 small mammals representing twenty species (six shrew species, fourteen rodent species). Three new species that need to be described were recorded. We observed a mixture of both true forest species and of species adapted to a wider range of habitats ranging from savannah to forest clearings. Species with either Sudanian or Guinea-Congolian affinities were recorded, as well as a new species endemic to Togo and Benin. This rich biodiversity underlines the urgent need for an effective protection of these forests. The Sudanian species Crocidura cf. foxi was more abundant in Wari-Maro than in Agoua forest, while the Guineo-Congolian species Praomys misonnei and Hylomyscus sp were only captured in Agoua forest. These results are in agreement with the fact that these two forests belong to two distinct chorological zones.Resume},

The abundance pattern showed a phase of low-to-medium abundances (June 2000-March 2002) leading to a peak (October 2002) followed by a dramatic crash ending in total Population disappearance induced by general flooding of the area in October 2003. Reproduction started well after the end of the rainy season, contrary to observations for this genus elsewhere. Survival was very low between the end of the rainy season and the middle of the dry season, then high during the rest of the dry season. The annual flood of the Niger River was found to have a major influence oil Population and spatial dynamics of M. huberti in this area by eliminating available ground surface in high-flood years, thus causing local extinction, and by delaying the onset of reproduction to the beginning of the dry season. Overall, the dynamics of multimammate rats in the inner delta of the Niger River appeared to be linked to rainfall and flooding patterns in a complex way. Maximum demographic growth appeared to be associated with intermediate levels of flood height, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.},

This disease is endemic in most of Africa, the Middle, Near East, and large parts of Asia. The causal agent is peste des petits ruminants virus ({PPRV}), which belongs to the genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. This genus also includes measles virus ({MV}), canine distemper virus ({CDV}) and rinderpest virus ({RPV}). All are closely related viruses with serological cross reactivity. In this study, we have developed a Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System ({LIPS}) for the rapid detection of antibodies against {PPRV} in serum samples and for specific differentiation from antibodies against {RPV}. {PPR} and rinderpest ({RP}) serum samples were assayed by {PPR}-{LIPS} and two commercially available {PPR} {cELISA} tests. The {PPR}-{LIPS} showed high sensitivity and specificity for the samples tested and showed no cross reactivity with {RPV} unlike the commercial {PPR} {cELISA} tests which did cross react with {RPV}. Based on the results shown in this study, {PPR}-{LIPS} is presented as a good candidate for the specific serosurveillance of {PPR}.},

	abstract = {We provide a global, spatially explicit characterization of 47 terrestrial habitat types, as defined in the International Union for Conservation of Nature ({IUCN}) habitat classification scheme, which is widely used in ecological analyses, including for quantifying species’ Area of Habitat. We produced this novel habitat map for the year 2015 by creating a global decision tree that intersects the best currently available global data on land cover, climate and land use. We independently validated the map using occurrence data for 828 species of vertebrates (35152 point plus 8181 polygonal occurrences) and 6026 sampling sites. Across datasets and mapped classes we found on average a balanced accuracy of 0.77 (\$\${\textbackslash}bar\{+\}\$\$0.14 {SD}) at Level 1 and 0.71 (\$\${\textbackslash}bar\{+\}\$\$0.15 {SD}) at Level 2, while noting potential issues of using occurrence records for validation. The maps broaden our understanding of habitats globally, assist in constructing area of habitat refinements and are relevant for broad-scale ecological studies and future {IUCN} Red List assessments. Periodic updates are planned as better or more recent data becomes available.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever ({LF}), a zoonotic illness, represents a public health burden in West African countries where the Lassa virus ({LASV}) circulates among rodents. Human exposure hinges significantly on {LASV} ecology, which is in turn shaped by various parameters such as weather seasonality and even virus and rodent-host genetics. Furthermore, human behaviour, despite playing a key role in the zoonotic nature of the disease, critically affects either the spread or control of human-to-human transmission. Previous estimations on {LF} burden date from the 80s and it is unclear how the population expansion and the improvement on diagnostics and surveillance methods have affected such predictions. Although recent data have contributed to the awareness of epidemics, the real impact of {LF} in West African communities will only be possible with the intensification of interdisciplinary efforts in research and public health approaches. This review discusses the causes and consequences of {LF} from a One Health perspective, and how the application of this concept can improve the surveillance and control of this disease in West Africa.},

We used reverse transcription {PCR} and resequencing microarrays to detect {LASV} in 41 of 214 samples from rodents captured at 8 locations in Sierra Leone. Phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences of nucleoprotein ({NP}), glycoprotein precursor ({GPC}), and polymerase (L) genes showed 5 separate clades within lineage {IV} of {LASV} in this country. The sequence diversity was higher than previously observed; mean diversity was 7.01\% for nucleoprotein gene at the nucleotide level.

	abstract = {Reproducibility is a key tenet of the scientific process that dictates the reliability and generality of results and methods. The complexities of ecological observations and data present novel challenges in satisfying needs for reproducibility and also transparency. Ecological systems are dynamic and heterogeneous, interacting with numerous factors that sculpt natural history and that investigators cannot completely control. Observations may be highly dependent on spatial and temporal context, making them very difficult to reproduce, but computational reproducibility can still be achieved. Computational reproducibility often refers to the ability to produce equivalent analytical outcomes from the same data set using the same code and software as the original study. When coded workflows are shared, authors and editors provide transparency for readers and allow other researchers to build directly and efficiently on primary work. These qualities may be especially important in ecological applications that have important or controversial implications for science, management, and policy. Expectations for computational reproducibility and transparency are shifting rapidly in the sciences. In this work, we highlight many of the unique challenges for ecology along with practical guidelines for reproducibility and transparency, as ecologists continue to participate in the stewardship of critical environmental information and ensure that research methods demonstrate integrity.},

Usually asymptomatic, toxoplasmosis can be severe and even fatal to many hosts, including people. Elucidating the contribution of genetic variation among parasites to patterns of disease transmission and manifestations has been the goal of many studies. Focusing on the geographic component of this variation, we show that most genotypes are locale-specific, but some are found across continents and are closely related to each other, indicating a recent radiation of a pandemic genotype. Furthermore, we show that the geographic structure of T. gondii is extraordinary in having one population that is found in all continents except South America, whereas other populations are generally confined to South America, and yet another population is found worldwide. Our evidence suggests that South American and Eurasian populations have evolved separately until recently, when ships populated by rats, mice, and cats provided T. gondii with unprecedented migration opportunities, probably during the transatlantic slave trade. Our results explain several enigmatic features of the population structure of T. gondii and demonstrate how pervasive, prompt, and elusive the impact of human globalization is on nature.},

A global assessment of the consensus of evidence for leishmaniasis was performed at a sub-national level by aggregating information from a variety of sources. A database of records of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis occurrence was compiled from published literature, online reports, strain archives, and {GenBank} accessions. These, with a suite of biologically relevant environmental covariates, were used in a boosted regression tree modelling framework to generate global environmental risk maps for the leishmaniases.

	abstract = {Background Leptospirosis, a spirochaetal zoonosis, occurs in diverse epidemiological settings and affects vulnerable populations, such as rural subsistence farmers and urban slum dwellers. Although leptospirosis is a life-threatening disease and recognized as an important cause of pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome, the lack of global estimates for morbidity and mortality has contributed to its neglected disease status. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a systematic review of published morbidity and mortality studies and databases to extract information on disease incidence and case fatality ratios. Linear regression and Monte Carlo modelling were used to obtain age and gender-adjusted estimates of disease morbidity for countries and Global Burden of Disease ({GBD}) and {WHO} regions. We estimated mortality using models that incorporated age and gender-adjusted disease morbidity and case fatality ratios. The review identified 80 studies on disease incidence from 34 countries that met quality criteria. In certain regions, such as Africa, few quality assured studies were identified. The regression model, which incorporated country-specific variables of population structure, life expectancy at birth, distance from the equator, tropical island, and urbanization, accounted for a significant proportion (R2 = 0.60) of the variation in observed disease incidence. We estimate that there were annually 1.03 million cases (95\% {CI} 434,000–1,750,000) and 58,900 deaths (95\% {CI} 23,800–95,900) due to leptospirosis worldwide. A large proportion of cases (48\%, 95\% {CI} 40–61\%) and deaths (42\%, 95\% {CI} 34–53\%) were estimated to occur in adult males with age of 20–49 years. Highest estimates of disease morbidity and mortality were observed in {GBD} regions of South and Southeast Asia, Oceania, Caribbean, Andean, Central, and Tropical Latin America, and East Sub-Saharan Africa. Conclusions/Significance Leptospirosis is among the leading zoonotic causes of morbidity worldwide and accounts for numbers of deaths, which approach or exceed those for other causes of haemorrhagic fever. Highest morbidity and mortality were estimated to occur in resource-poor countries, which include regions where the burden of leptospirosis has been underappreciated.},

	abstract = {Quantifying mammalian biodiversity is a critical yet daunting challenge, particularly in species-rich ecosystems. Non-volant small mammals account for {\textgreater}60\% of the mammalian diversity and often require several survey methods to estimate their species richness and abundance, because of differences in their size and behaviour. Using 117 studies at 278 sites in a species-rich biome, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we determined the influence of trap configuration, trap type, and sampling effort on measures of species richness and abundance. We used generalised linear mixed-effects models to determine which methodological approaches influenced estimates of species richness and abundance at the sampling sites. We used estimates of beta (β) to determine which methods improved species richness and abundance estimates, and generated predicted values for the overall species richness as a function of trap configuration (line transect, grid, or both), trap type (pitfall traps, live-traps or both), and sampling effort (number of trap-nights). Our results indicated that sites in which pitfall traps alone were used generated higher estimates of the overall small mammal species richness and abundance, and rodent abundance, than sites in which only live-traps were used. Sites in which pitfall traps alone were used also produced higher estimates of species richness and abundance, and rodent species richness and abundance, than sites in which both trap types were used. Increased sampling effort led to increased estimates of species richness, but sites in which pitfall traps were used alone or together with live-traps had higher estimates of species richness with less sampling effort than sites in which live-traps only were used. Using pitfall traps greatly reduced the number of trap-nights necessary to obtain a good estimate of small mammal species richness in a community. We found no influence of trap configuration (line transects or grids) on estimates of species richness, but the abundance of rodents was estimated to be higher in sites where both line transects and grids were used, than in sites where only one trap configuration was used. Our review shows the importance of using pitfall traps in research, monitoring, and environmental impact studies on species-rich small mammal communities.},

We studied the activity and contribution of birds and mammals to intermediate ecosystem services (predation of weed seeds or invertebrate pests) and disservices (predation of crop seeds or beneficial invertebrates) in southern Sweden between June and November 2016. We measured seed and invertebrate predation rates using trays placed in front of 32 wildlife cameras in 16 cereal fields with a local habitat contrast (8 fields adjacent to another crop field and 8 fields adjacent to a semi-natural grassland) and along a landscape heterogeneity gradient (amount of semi-natural grassland). Both activity and predation were dominated by small mammals (mainly rodents), yet only a few species contributed to predation services and disservices according to camera records. Small mammal activity and predation varied considerably over time. Small mammal activity was significantly higher at trays with crop seeds or beneficial invertebrate prey compared to trays with pest prey, and crop seed predation by small mammals was significantly higher than weed seed predation. In contrast, bird activity and predation did not differ significantly between resource types, but varied over time depending on the habitat contrast. Predation of animal prey by birds was highest after cereal harvest, independent of habitat contrast. Our study highlights that birds and in particular rodents provide important intermediate ecosystem services, but also disservices, which fluctuate strongly in intensity over time.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems are multifunctional and provide humanity with a broad array of vital services. Effective management of services requires an improved evidence base, identifying the role of ecosystems in delivering multiple services, which can assist policy-makers in maintaining them. Here, information from the literature and scientific experts was used to systematically document the importance of services and identify trends in their use and status over time for the main terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in Europe. The results from this review show that intensively managed ecosystems contribute mostly to vital provisioning services (e.g. agro-ecosystems provide food via crops and livestock, and forests provide wood), while semi-natural ecosystems (e.g. grasslands and mountains) are key contributors of genetic resources and cultural services (e.g. aesthetic values and sense of place). The most recent European trends in human use of services show increases in demand for crops from agro-ecosystems, timber from forests, water flow regulation from rivers, wetlands and mountains, and recreation and ecotourism in most ecosystems, but decreases in livestock production, freshwater capture fisheries, wild foods and virtually all services associated with ecosystems which have considerably decreased in area (e.g. semi-natural grasslands). The condition of the majority of services show either a degraded or mixed status across Europe with the exception of recent enhancements in timber production in forests and mountains, freshwater provision, water/erosion/natural hazard regulation and recreation/ecotourism in mountains, and climate regulation in forests. Key gaps in knowledge were evident for certain services across all ecosystems, including the provision of biochemicals and natural medicines, genetic resources and the regulating services of seed dispersal, pest/disease regulation and invasion resistance.},

The majority of relationships between attributes and ecosystem services cited in the 530 studies were positive. For example, the services of water quality regulation, water flow regulation, mass flow regulation and landscape aesthetics were improved by increases in community and habitat area. Functional traits, such as richness and diversity, also displayed a predominantly positive relationship across the services, most commonly discussed for atmospheric regulation, pest regulation and pollination. A number of studies also discussed a positive correlation with stand age, particularly for atmospheric regulation. Species level traits were found to benefit a number of ecosystem services, with species abundance being particularly important for pest regulation, pollination and recreation, and species richness for timber production and freshwater fishing. Instances of biodiversity negatively affecting the examined ecosystem services were few in number for all ecosystem services, except freshwater provision. The review showed that ecosystem services are generated from numerous interactions occurring in complex systems. However, improving understanding of at least some of the key relationships between biodiversity and service provision will help guide effective management and protection strategies.},

	abstract = {The extent to which the array of land covers dominating anthropogenic landscapes impacts on biodiversity remains today an open question of great relevance. The characteristics of the animal communities inhabiting tropical forest early successional stages can determine, to a large extent, the course of secondary succession and natural regeneration. In this study, we evaluated the response of terrestrial rodents to variations in vegetation and landscape attributes, in early stages of tropical dry forest succession, at three integration levels: (1) communities, (2) populations, and (3) individuals. Our results reveal a rodent response to the variation in vegetation and landscape attributes, which indeed was largely modulated by seasonality, and determined by the focal spatial scale considered. In general, most of the species were favored by vegetation structure simplification and increase in understory density, probably due to the increase in refuge and trophic resources. Nevertheless, one species, Lyomis pictus, was sensitive to variation in vegetation composition and negatively affected by a reduction in vegetation structural complexity, which could be explained by the high number of tree seeds included in their diet. We found a higher diversity of rodents in sites surrounded by a high coverage and connectivity of dry and riparian forest, probably because large forest patches act as sources of species and the forest connectivity favors the colonization process toward sites under regeneration. Our results showed that preserving remnants of the original vegetation and implementing management actions at different spatial scales in anthropogenic landscapes is critical for preventing: (1) an increase in generalist populations, (2) rapid faunal homogenization, (3) defaunation, and (4) the loss of specialist species; with profound implications for the ecology of forest, ecosystem services and human health.},

To investigate the potential of small carnivores for the biological control of rodents within agro-ecosystems, we assessed both the ecological and social landscapes within two rural villages in the Vhembe Biosphere Reserve, South Africa. We employed a camera trapping survey underpinned by an occupancy modelling framework to distinguish between ecological and observation processes affecting small carnivore occupancy. We also used questionnaires to investigate perceptions of small carnivores and their role in pest control. We found the greatest diversity of small carnivores in land used for cropping in comparison to grazing or settlements. Probability of use by small carnivores was influenced negatively by the relative abundance of domestic dogs and positively by the relative abundance of livestock. Greater carnivore diversity and probability of use could be mediated through habitat heterogeneity, food abundance, or reduced competition from domestic carnivores. Village residents failed to appreciate the role of small carnivores in rodent control. Our results suggest that there is significant, although undervalued, potential for small carnivores to provide ecosystem services in agro-ecosystems.},

	abstract = {In agriculture, both valuable ecosystem services and unwanted ecosystem disservices can be produced by the same organism group. For example, small rodents can provide biological control through weed seed consumption but may also act as pests, causing crop damage. We studied the hypothesized causal relationships between ecosystem services (removal of weed seeds) and disservices (removal of wheat grains and crop damage) derived by small rodents (voles and mice) at multiple spatial scales. At the landscape scale, we studied the effects of landscape compositional and configurational heterogeneity on the abundance of voles and mice and their related ecosystem services and disservices along the former inner German border in east and west Germany. At the local scale, we studied how abundance and ecosystem functions are affected by management intensity (organic vs. conventional winter wheat), associated differences in crop characteristics and edge effects. Linear mixed-effects models and path analysis show that voles drove ecosystem disservices, but not ecosystem services, in agricultural fields. Daily wheat seed removal by voles was influenced by increasing wheat height and was almost three times higher than weed seed removal, which was not related to local- or landscape-scale effects. Abundance of voles and associated crop damage decreased with lower crop density and higher wheat height, which were associated with organic farming. Abundance of voles and crop damage were highest in conventional fields in west Germany. Synthesis and applications. As the ecosystem disservice of wheat seed consumption by small rodents must be considered mainly during crop sowing, management before crop harvest should focus on decreasing the pest potential of voles but not mice. Our results suggest that densities of voles and their ecosystem disservices could be reduced by having fields with low crop density and high wheat height, practices associated with organic farming. Surrounding landscapes with low compositional and configurational heterogeneity could further reduce voles’ pest potential, but with probable negative effects on farmland biodiversity.},

In addition to images of wild animals, research cameras often record human images, inadvertently capturing behaviours ranging from innocuous actions to potentially serious crimes. 2. With the increasing use of camera traps, there is an urgent need to reflect on how researchers should deal with human images caught on cameras. On the one hand, it is important to respect the privacy of individuals caught on cameras, while, on the other hand, there is a larger public duty to report illegal activity. This creates ethical dilemmas for researchers. 3. Here, based on our camera-trap research on snow leopards Panthera uncia, we outline a general code of conduct to help improve the practice of camera trap based research and help researchers better navigate the ethical-legal tightrope of this important research tool.},

	abstract = {The fields of viral ecology and evolution are rapidly expanding, motivated in part by concerns around emerging zoonoses. One consequence is the proliferation of host–virus association data, which underpin viral macroecology and zoonotic risk prediction but remain fragmented across numerous data portals. In the present article, we propose that synthesis of host–virus data is a central challenge to characterize the global virome and develop foundational theory in viral ecology. To illustrate this, we build an open database of mammal host–virus associations that reconciles four published data sets. We show that this offers a substantially richer view of the known virome than any individual source data set but also that databases such as these risk becoming out of date as viral discovery accelerates. We argue for a shift in practice toward the development, incremental updating, and use of synthetic data sets in viral ecology, to improve replicability and facilitate work to predict the structure and dynamics of the global virome.},

	abstract = {This paper argues that contemporary processes of extended urbanisation, which include suburbanisation, post-suburbanisation and peri-urbanisation, may result in increased vulnerability to infectious disease spread. Through a review of existing literature at the nexus of urbanisation and infectious disease, we consider how this (potential) increased vulnerability to infectious diseases in peri- or suburban areas is in fact dialectically related to socio-material transformations on the metropolitan edge. In particular, we highlight three key factors influencing the spread of infectious disease that have been identified in the literature: demographic change, infrastructure and governance. These have been chosen given both the prominence of these themes and their role in shaping the spread of disease on the urban edge. Further, we suggest how a landscape political ecology framework can be useful for examining the role of socio-ecological transformations in generating increased risk of infectious disease in peri- and suburban areas. To illustrate our arguments we will draw upon examples from various re-emerging infectious disease events and outbreaks around the world to reveal how extended urbanisation in the broadest sense has amplified the conditions necessary for the spread of infectious diseases. We thus call for future research on the spatialities of health and disease to pay attention to how variegated patterns of extended urbanisation may influence possible outbreaks and the mechanisms through which such risks can be alleviated.},

	abstract = {Ebola virus disease ({EVD}) is a complex zoonosis that is highly virulent in humans. The largest recorded outbreak of {EVD} is ongoing in West Africa, outside of its previously reported and predicted niche. We assembled location data on all recorded zoonotic transmission to humans and Ebola virus infection in bats and primates (1976–2014). Using species distribution models, these occurrence data were paired with environmental covariates to predict a zoonotic transmission niche covering 22 countries across Central and West Africa. Vegetation, elevation, temperature, evapotranspiration, and suspected reservoir bat distributions define this relationship. At-risk areas are inhabited by 22 million people; however, the rarity of human outbreaks emphasises the very low probability of transmission to humans. Increasing population sizes and international connectivity by air since the first detection of {EVD} in 1976 suggest that the dynamics of human-to-human secondary transmission in contemporary outbreaks will be very different to those of the past.
          , 
            Since the first outbreaks of Ebola virus disease in 1976, there have been numerous other outbreaks in humans across Africa with fatality rates ranging from 50\% to 90\%. Humans can become infected with the Ebola virus after direct contact with blood or bodily fluids from an infected person or animal. The virus also infects and kills other primates—such as chimpanzees or gorillas—though Old World fruit bats are suspected to be the most likely carriers of the virus in the wild.
            The largest recorded outbreak of Ebola virus disease is ongoing in West Africa: more people have been infected in this current outbreak than in all previous outbreaks combined. The current outbreak is also the first to occur in West Africa—which is outside the previously known range of the Ebola virus.
            Pigott et al. have now updated predictions about where in Africa wild animals may harbour the virus and where the transmission of the virus from these animals to humans is possible. As such, the map identifies the regions that are most at risk of a future Ebola outbreak. The data behind these new maps include the locations of all recorded primary cases of Ebola in human populations—the ‘index’ cases—many of which have been linked to animal sources. The data also include the locations of recorded cases of Ebola virus infections in wild bats and primates from the last forty years. The maps, which were modelled using more flexible methods than previous predictions, also include new information—collected using satellites—about environmental factors and new predictions of the range of wild fruit bats.
            Pigott et al. report that the transmission of Ebola virus from animals to humans is possible in 22 countries across Central and West Africa—and that 22 million people live in the areas at risk. However, outbreaks in human populations are rare and the likelihood of a human getting the disease from an infected animal still remains very low. The updated map does not include data about how infections spread from one person to another, so the next challenge is to use existing data on human-to-human transmission to better understand the likely size and extent of current and future outbreaks. As more people live in, and travel to and from, the at-risk regions than ever before, Pigott et al. note that new outbreaks of Ebola virus disease are likely to be very different to those of the past.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Utilitarian arguments concerning the value of biodiversity often include the benefits of animals, plants, and microbes as sources of medicines and as laboratory models of disease. The concept that species diversity per se may influence risk of exposure to disease has not been well developed, however. We present a conceptual model of how high species richness and evenness in communities of terrestrial vertebrates may reduce risk of exposure to Lyme disease, a spirochetal ( Borrelia burgdorferi) disease transmitted by ixodid tick vectors. Many ticks never become infected because some hosts are highly inefficient at transmitting spirochete infections to feeding ticks. In North America, the most competent reservoir host for the Lyme disease agent is the white-footed mouse ( Peromyscus leucopus), a species that is widespread and locally abundant. We suggest that increases in species diversity within host communities may dilute the power of white-footed mice to infect ticks by causing more ticks to feed on inefficient disease reservoirs. High species diversity therefore is expected to result in lower prevalence of infection in ticks and consequently in lower risk of human exposure to Lyme disease. Analyses of states and multistate regions along the east coast of the United States demonstrated significant negative correlations between species richness of terrestrial small mammals (orders Rodentia, Insectivora, and Lagomorpha), a key group of hosts for ticks, and per capita numbers of reported Lyme disease cases, which supports our “dilution effect” hypothesis. We contrasted these findings to what might be expected when vectors acquire disease agents efficiently from many hosts, in which case infection prevalence of ticks may increase with increasing diversity hosts. A positive correlation between per capita Lyme disease cases and species richness of ground-dwelling birds supported this hypothesis, which we call the “rescue effect.” The reservoir competence of hosts within vertebrate communities and the degree of specialization by ticks on particular hosts will strongly influence the relationship between species diversity and the risk of exposure to the many vector-borne diseases that plague humans.},

The study found several examples in which agricultural intensification and/or environmental change were associated with an increased risk of zoonotic disease emergence, driven by the impact of an expanding human population and changing human behavior on the environment. We conclude that the rate of future zoonotic disease emergence or reemergence will be closely linked to the evolution of the agriculture–environment nexus. However, available research inadequately addresses the complexity and interrelatedness of environmental, biological, economic, and social dimensions of zoonotic pathogen emergence, which significantly limits our ability to predict, prevent, and respond to zoonotic disease emergence.},

	abstract = {Land-use change has a direct impact on species survival and reproduction, altering their spatio-temporal distributions. It acts as a selective force that favours the abundance and diversity of reservoir hosts and affects host–pathogen dynamics and prevalence. This has led to land-use change being a significant driver of infectious diseases emergence. Here, we predict the presence of rodent taxa and map the zoonotic hazard (potential sources of harm) from rodent-borne diseases in the short and long term (2025 and 2050). The study considers three different land-use scenarios based on the shared socioeconomic pathways narratives ({SSPs}): sustainable ({SSP}1-Representative Concentration Pathway ({RCP}) 2.6), fossil-fuelled development ({SSP}5-{RCP} 8.5) and deepening inequality ({SSP}4-{RCP} 6.0). We found that cropland expansion into forest and pasture may increase zoonotic hazards in areas with high rodent-species diversity. Nevertheless, a future sustainable scenario may not always reduce hazards. All scenarios presented high heterogeneity in zoonotic hazard, with high-income countries having the lowest hazard range. The {SSPs} narratives suggest that opening borders and reducing cropland expansion are critical to mitigate current and future zoonotic hazards globally, particularly in middle- and low-income economies. Our study advances previous efforts to anticipate the emergence of zoonotic diseases by integrating past, present and future information to guide surveillance and mitigation of zoonotic hazards at the regional and local scale.

	abstract = {In the light of the urgency raised by the {COVID}-19 pandemic, global investment in wildlife virology is likely to increase, and new surveillance programmes will identify hundreds of novel viruses that might someday pose a threat to humans. To support the extensive task of laboratory characterization, scientists may increasingly rely on data-driven rubrics or machine learning models that learn from known zoonoses to identify which animal pathogens could someday pose a threat to global health. We synthesize the findings of an interdisciplinary workshop on zoonotic risk technologies to answer the following questions. What are the prerequisites, in terms of open data, equity and interdisciplinary collaboration, to the development and application of those tools? What effect could the technology have on global health? Who would control that technology, who would have access to it and who would benefit from it? Would it improve pandemic prevention? Could it create new challenges?

The cowpox virus is a zoonosis which circulates in these rodent hosts and has been shown to have an adverse effect on reproductive output. The transmission dynamics within species is best described as frequency dependent rather than density dependent, contrary to the ‘mass action’ assumption of most previous studies, both theoretical and empirical. Estimation of a transmission coefficient for each species in each population also allows annual and seasonal variations in transmission dynamics to be investigated through an analysis of regression residuals. Transmission between host species is found to be negligible despite their close co–habitation. The consequences of this for the combining ability of hosts as zoonotic reservoirs, and for apparent competition between hosts, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Infectious diseases of humans, wildlife, and domesticated species are increasing worldwide, driving the need to understand the mechanisms that shape outbreaks. Simultaneously, human activities are drastically reducing biodiversity. These concurrent patterns have prompted repeated suggestions that biodiversity and disease are linked. For example, the dilution effect hypothesis posits that these patterns are causally related; diverse host communities inhibit the spread of parasites via several mechanisms, such as by regulating populations of susceptible hosts or interfering with parasite transmission. However, the generality of the dilution effect hypothesis remains controversial, especially for zoonotic diseases of humans. Here we provide broad evidence that host diversity inhibits parasite abundance using a meta-analysis of 202 effect sizes on 61 parasite species. The magnitude of these effects was independent of host density, study design, and type and specialization of parasites, indicating that dilution was robust across all ecological contexts examined. However, the magnitude of dilution was more closely related to the frequency, rather than density, of focal host species. Importantly, observational studies overwhelmingly documented dilution effects, and there was also significant evidence for dilution effects of zoonotic parasites of humans. Thus, dilution effects occur commonly in nature, and they may modulate human disease risk. A second analysis identified similar effects of diversity in plant–herbivore systems. Thus, although there can be exceptions, our results indicate that biodiversity generally decreases parasitism and herbivory. Consequently, anthropogenic declines in biodiversity could increase human and wildlife diseases and decrease crop and forest production.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever ({LF}) is a viral hemorrhagic disease found in Sub-Saharan Africa and is responsible for up to 300,000 cases and 5000 deaths annually. {LF} is highly endemic in Sierra Leone, particularly in its Eastern Province. Kenema Government Hospital ({KGH}) maintains one of only a few {LF} isolation facilities in the world with year-round diagnostic testing. Here we focus on space-time trends for {LF} occurring in Sierra Leone between 2012 and 2019 to provide a current account of {LF} in the wake of the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic. Data were analyzed for 3277 suspected {LF} cases and classified as acute, recent, and non-{LF} or prior {LF} exposure using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ({ELISAs}). Presentation rates for acute, recent, and non-{LF} or prior {LF} exposure were 6.0\% (195/3277), 25.6\% (838/3277), and 68.4\% (2244/3277), respectively. Among 2051 non-{LF} or prior {LF} exposures, 33.2\% (682/2051) tested positive for convalescent {LF} exposure. The overall {LF} case-fatality rate ({CFR}) was 78.5\% (106/135). Both clinical presentations and confirmed {LF} cases declined following the Ebola epidemic. These declines coincided with an increased duration between illness onset and clinical presentation, perhaps suggesting more severe disease or presentation at later stages of illness. Acute {LF} cases and their corresponding {CFRs} peaked during the dry season (November to April). Subjects with recent (but not acute) {LF} exposure were more likely to present during the rainy season (May to October) than the dry season (p {\textless} 0.001). The findings here suggest that {LF} remains endemic in Sierra Leone and that caseloads are likely to resume at levels observed prior to the Ebola epidemic. The results provide insight on the current epidemiological profile of {LF} in Sierra Leone to facilitate {LF} vaccine studies and accentuate the need for {LF} cohort studies and continued advancements in {LF} diagnostics.},

Although disease progression is fairly similar for {SARS} and {MERS}, the case fatality rate of {MERS} is much higher than that of {SARS}.Comorbidities have an important role in {SARS} and {MERS}. Several risk factors are associated with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) in {SARS} and {MERS} cases, especially advanced age and male sex. For {MERS}, additional risk factors that are associated with severe disease include chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cancer, renal and lung disease, and co-infections.Although the ancestors of {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} probably circulate in bats, zoonotic transmission of {SARS}-{CoV} required an incidental amplifying host. Dromedary camels are the {MERS}-{CoV} reservoir from which zoonotic transmission occurs; serological evidence indicates that {MERS}-{CoV}-like viruses have been circulating in dromedary camels for at least three decades.Human-to-human transmission of {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} occurs mainly in health care settings. Patients do not shed large amounts of virus until well after the onset of symptoms, when patients are most probably already seeking medical care. Analysis of hospital surfaces after the treatment of patients with {MERS} showed the ubiquitous presence of infectious virus.Our understanding of the pathogenesis of {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} is still incomplete, but the combination of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and an aberrant immune response is thought to have a crucial role in the severity of both syndromes.The severity of the diseases that are caused by emerging coronaviruses highlights the need to develop effective therapeutic measures against these viruses. Although several treatments for {SARS} and {MERS} (based on inhibition of viral replication with drugs or neutralizing antibodies, or on dampening the host response) have been identified in animal models and in vitro studies, efficacy data from human clinical trials are urgently required.},

The Ashanti region has recorded the second highest deforestation rates. Despite the government's efforts to maintain and protect Ghana's forest reserves, deforestation continues. We observed deforestation patterns in the Ashanti region of Ghana from 1986 to 2015 using Landsat imagery to identify the main causes of deforestation. We obtained and processed two adjacent Landsat images from the United States Geological Survey's ({USGS}) National Centre for Earth Resources Observation and Science at 30 m spatial resolution for 1986, 2002, and 2015. We then supported the results with findings from 291 farm household surveys in communities fringing the forest reserves. By 2015, dense forest covered 53.3\% of the land area of the forest reserves, and the remaining area had been disturbed. Expansion of annual crop farms and tree crops caused 78\% of the forest loss within the 29-year period. Afforestation projects are ongoing some of which employ the participation of farmers, yet agricultural expansion exerts more pressure on the remaining dense forest. Agricultural intensification on existing farmlands may reduce farm expansion into the remaining forest areas. Strengthening and enforcing forest protection laws could minimise the extent of agricultural encroachment into forests. Mixed tree-crop systems could reduce the effects of arable farming on deforestation, limit the clearance of trees from farmlands, enhance the provision of ecosystem services, and improve the soil's fertility and moisture content. A forest transition may be underway leading to more trees in agricultural systems and better protection of residual natural forests.},

Recent molecular studies have confirmed the fundamental role of the rodent host (Mastomys natalensis) in driving human infections, but control and prevention efforts remain hampered by a limited baseline understanding of the disease’s true incidence, geographical distribution and underlying drivers. Here, we show that Lassa fever occurrence and incidence is influenced by climate, poverty, agriculture and urbanisation factors. However, heterogeneous reporting processes and diagnostic laboratory access also appear to be important drivers of the patchy distribution of observed disease incidence. Using spatiotemporal predictive models we show that including climatic variability added retrospective predictive value over a baseline model (11\% decrease in out-of-sample predictive error). However, predictions for 2020 show that a climate-driven model performs similarly overall to the baseline model. Overall, with ongoing improvements in surveillance there may be potential for forecasting Lassa fever incidence to inform health planning.},

Important factors necessary to understand zoonotic disease ecology include those associated with distribution and population dynamics of reservoir species as well as infection dynamics. Results are based on more than 851,000 trap nights, 16,608 individual deer mice and 10,572 collected blood samples. Deer mice were distributed throughout every habitat we sampled and were present during every sampling period in all habitats except high altitude habitats over 1900 m. Abundance varied greatly among locations with peak numbers occurring mostly during fall. However, peak rodent abundance occurred during fall, winter and spring during various years on three grids trapped 12 months/yr. Prevalence of antibodies to {SNV} averaged 3.9\% to 22.1\% but no grids had mice with antibodies during every month. The maximum period without antibody-positive mice ranged from 1 to 52 months, or even more at high altitude grids where deer mice were not always present. Months without antibody-positive mice were more prevalent during fall than spring. Population fluctuations were not synchronous over broad geographic areas and antibody prevalences were not well spatially consistent, differing greatly over short distances. We observed an apparently negative, but nonstatistically significant relationship between average antibody prevalence and average deer mouse population abundance and a statistically significant positive relationship between the average number of antibody positive mice and average population abundance. We present data from which potential researchers can estimate the effort required to adequately describe the ecology of a rodent-borne viral system. We address different factors affecting population dynamics and hantavirus antibody prevalence and discuss the path to understanding a complex rodent-borne disease system as well as the obstacles in that path.},

Building on syndemic theory in medical anthropology, we propose the term “synzootics” to describe co-occurring enzootic or epizootic processes that produce worse health outcomes in wild animals. Using framing from syndemic theory, we describe how the synzootic concept offers new insights into the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases. We then recommend a set of empirical criteria and lines of evidence that can be used to identify synzootics in nature. We conclude by exploring how synzootics could indirectly drive the emergence of novel pathogens in human populations.},

	abstract = {Forecasting the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir populations of wild or domestic animals is essential for the effective deployment of interventions such as wildlife vaccination or culling. Due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust, spatially explicit, predictions is challenging. Recent efforts have begun to make progress in this direction by capitalizing on machine learning methodologies. An important weakness of existing approaches, however, is that they generally rely on combining human and reservoir infection data during the training process and thus conflate risk attributable to the prevalence of the pathogen in the reservoir population with the risk attributed to the realized rate of spillover into the human population. Because effective planning of interventions requires that these components of risk be disentangled, we developed a multi-layer machine learning framework that separates these processes. Our approach begins by training models to predict the geographic range of the primary reservoir and the subset of this range in which the pathogen occurs. The spillover risk predicted by the product of these reservoir specific models is then fit to data on realized patterns of historical spillover into the human population. The result is a geographically specific spillover risk forecast that can be easily decomposed and used to guide effective intervention. Applying our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that regularly spills over into the human population across West Africa, results in a model that explains a modest but statistically significant portion of geographic variation in historical patterns of spillover. When combined with a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics, our spillover risk model predicts that 897,700 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year across West Africa, with Nigeria accounting for more than half of these human infections.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasmosis is one of the most prevalent infections in humans and animals caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). Rodents, as intermediate and reservoir hosts, play a key role in the maintenance and transmission of T. gondii. They can be contaminated and maintain the parasite in the form of cysts in their bodies, demonstrating an infection source for their offsprings, predators (particularly felids), and other animals. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis study was carried out to evaluate the global seroprevalence of T. gondii in these mammals. For achieving the purpose of the current study, six English databases ({PubMed}, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, {ProQuest}, and Google Scholar) were systematically searched for related studies from 1970 to 2018. Finally, a total of 52,372 records were screened, 105 records including 26,221 rodents were incorporated in the present study. By random effect models, the overall seroprevalence was calculated at 6\% (95\% {CI} = 6–7\%), with the highest amount was observed in Africa (24\%) and South America (18\%), and the lowest amount in Europe (1\%). The subgroup data analysis by gender manifested that the prevalence of Immunoglobulin G antibodies did not differ between genders (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Due to the significant heterogeneity, meta-regression models were applied based on serological techniques and continental regions; however, the obtained values were not statistically significant (P = 0.480 and P = 0.295, respectively). The present study revealed a relatively low level of T. gondii seroprevalence in rodents; however, if they were the main food source for their predators, they would cause high transmission of T. gondii.},

Here, we evaluate whether current estimates of host-level viral diversity in wild mammals are stable enough to be considered biologically meaningful, by analysing a comprehensive dataset of discovery dates of 6571 unique mammal host-virus associations between 1930 and 2018. We show that virus discovery rates in mammal hosts are either constant or accelerating, with little evidence of declines towards viral richness asymptotes, even in highly sampled hosts. Consequently, inference of relative viral richness across host species has been unstable over time, particularly in bats, where intensified surveillance since the early 2000s caused a rapid rearrangement of species' ranked viral richness. Our results illustrate that comparative inference of host-level virus diversity across mammals is highly sensitive to even short-term changes in sampling effort. We advise caution to avoid overinterpreting patterns in current data, since it is feasible that an analysis conducted today could draw quite different conclusions than one conducted only a decade ago.},

	abstract = {Species distribution modeling, in combination with databases of specimen distribution records, is advocated as a solution to the problem of distributional data limitation in biogeography and ecology. The global biodiversity information facility ({GBIF}), a portal that collates digitized collection and survey data, is the largest online provider of distribution records. However, all distributional databases are spatially biassed due to uneven effort of sampling, data storage and mobilization. Such bias is particularly pronounced in {GBIF}, where nation-wide differences in funding and data sharing lead to huge differences in contribution to {GBIF}. We use a common Eurasian butterfly (Aglais urticae) as an exemplar taxon to provide evidence that range model quality is decreasing due to the spatial clustering of distributional records in {GBIF}. Furthermore, we show that such loss of model quality would go unnoticed with standard methods of model quality evaluation. Using evaluations of model predictions of the Swiss distribution of the species, we compare distribution models of full data with data where a subsampling procedure removes spatial bias at the cost of record numbers, but not of spatial extent of records. We show that data with less spatial bias produce better predictive models even though they are based on less input data. Our subsampling routine may therefore be a suitable method to reduce the impact of spatial bias to species distribution models. Our results warn of automatized applications of species distribution models to distributional databases (as has been advocated and implemented), as internal model evaluation did not show the decline of model quality with increased spatial bias (but rather the opposite) while expert evaluation clearly did.},

In this article, we describe the increased data content of {PHI}-base, plus new database features and further integration with complementary databases. The release of {PHI}-base version 4.8 (September 2019) contains 3454 manually curated references, and provides information on 6780 genes from 268 pathogens, tested on 210 hosts in 13,801 interactions. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens are represented in almost equal numbers. Host species consist of approximately 60\% plants (split 50:50 between cereal and non-cereal plants), and 40\% other species of medical and/or environmental importance. The information available on pathogen effectors has risen by more than a third, and the entries for pathogens that infect crop species of global importance has dramatically increased in this release. We also briefly describe the future direction of the {PHI}-base project, and some existing problems with the {PHI}-base curation process.},

Here we present an updated version of the Global Mammal Parasite Database, a database of the parasites of wild ungulates (artiodactyls and perissodactyls), carnivores, and primates, and make it available for download as complete flat files. The updated database has more than 24,000 entries in the main data file alone, representing data from over 2700 literature sources. We include data on sampling method and sample sizes when reported, as well as both “reported” and “corrected” (i.e., standardized) binomials for each host and parasite species. Also included are current higher taxonomies and data on transmission modes used by the majority of species of parasites in the database. In the associated metadata we describe the methods used to identify sources and extract data from the primary literature, how entries were checked for errors, methods used to georeference entries, and how host and parasite taxonomies were standardized across the database.

        Recent findings 
        The majority of emerging infectious disease events over recent decades, including the {COVID}-19 pandemic, have been caused by zoonotic viruses and bacteria. In particular, coronaviruses, haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses and influenza A viruses have caused significant epidemics globally. There have been recent advances in understanding the origins and drivers of zoonotic epidemics, yet there are gaps in diagnostic capacity and clinical training about zoonoses.
        Summary 
        Identifying the origins of zoonotic pathogens, understanding factors influencing disease transmission and improving the diagnostic capacity of clinicians will be crucial to early detection and prevention of further epidemics of zoonoses.},

Plenty of such methods have been designed to accomplish this task: most of them deal with undirected and unweighted networks only, but a few are capable of handling directed and/or weighted networks too, thus properly exploiting richer information. In this work, we contribute to the effort of comparing the different methods for comparing networks and providing a guide for the selection of an appropriate one. First, we review and classify a collection of network comparison methods, highlighting the criteria they are based on and their advantages and drawbacks. The set includes methods requiring known node-correspondence, such as {DeltaCon} and Cut Distance, as well as methods not requiring a priori known node-correspondence, such as alignment-based, graphlet-based, and spectral methods, and the recently proposed Portrait Divergence and {NetLSD}. We test the above methods on synthetic networks and we assess their usability and the meaningfulness of the results they provide. Finally, we apply the methods to two real-world datasets, the European Air Transportation Network and the {FAO} Trade Network, in order to discuss the results that can be drawn from this type of analysis.},

Unlike newly emerging zoonoses that attract the attention of the developed world, these endemic zoonoses are by comparison neglected. This is, in part, a consequence of under-reporting, resulting in underestimation of their global burden, which in turn artificially downgrades their importance in the eyes of administrators and funding agencies. The development of cheap and effective vaccines is no guarantee that these endemic diseases will be eliminated in the near future. However, simply increasing awareness about their causes and how they may be prevented—often with very simple technologies—could reduce the incidence of many endemic zoonoses. Sustainable control of zoonoses is reliant on surveillance, but, as with other public-sector animal health services, this is rarely implemented in the developing world, not least because of the lack of sufficiently cheap diagnostics. Public–private partnerships have already provided advocacy for human disease control and could be equally effective in addressing endemic zoonoses.},

Furthermore, new {JSDM} implementations have been illustrated with different case studies, preventing direct comparisons of computational and statistical performance. We aim to resolve these outstanding issues by (a) highlighting similarities among seven presence–absence {JSDMs} using a clearly defined, singular notation; and (b) evaluating the computational and statistical performance of each {JSDM} using six datasets that vary widely in numbers of sites, species, and environmental covariates considered. Our singular notation shows that many of the {JSDMs} are very similar, and in turn parameter estimates of different {JSDMs} are moderate to strongly, positively correlated. In contrast, the different {JSDMs} clearly differ in computational efficiency and memory limitations. Our framework will allow ecologists to make educated decisions about the {JSDM} that best suits their objective, and enable wider uptake of {JSDM} methods among the ecological community.},

	abstract = {Background
Cases of human monkeypox are rarely seen outside of west and central Africa. There are few data regarding viral kinetics or the duration of viral shedding and no licensed treatments. Two oral drugs, brincidofovir and tecovirimat, have been approved for treatment of smallpox and have demonstrated efficacy against monkeypox in animals. Our aim was to describe the longitudinal clinical course of monkeypox in a high-income setting, coupled with viral dynamics, and any adverse events related to novel antiviral therapies.
Methods
In this retrospective observational study, we report the clinical features, longitudinal virological findings, and response to off-label antivirals in seven patients with monkeypox who were diagnosed in the {UK} between 2018 and 2021, identified through retrospective case-note review. This study included all patients who were managed in dedicated high consequence infectious diseases ({HCID}) centres in Liverpool, London, and Newcastle, coordinated via a national {HCID} network.
Findings
We reviewed all cases since the inception of the {HCID} (airborne) network between Aug 15, 2018, and Sept 10, 2021, identifying seven patients. Of the seven patients, four were men and three were women. Three acquired monkeypox in the {UK}: one patient was a health-care worker who acquired the virus nosocomially, and one patient who acquired the virus abroad transmitted it to an adult and child within their household cluster. Notable disease features included viraemia, prolonged monkeypox virus {DNA} detection in upper respiratory tract swabs, reactive low mood, and one patient had a monkeypox virus {PCR}-positive deep tissue abscess. Five patients spent more than 3 weeks (range 22–39 days) in isolation due to prolonged {PCR} positivity. Three patients were treated with brincidofovir (200 mg once a week orally), all of whom developed elevated liver enzymes resulting in cessation of therapy. One patient was treated with tecovirimat (600 mg twice daily for 2 weeks orally), experienced no adverse effects, and had a shorter duration of viral shedding and illness (10 days hospitalisation) compared with the other six patients. One patient experienced a mild relapse 6 weeks after hospital discharge.
Interpretation
Human monkeypox poses unique challenges, even to well resourced health-care systems with {HCID} networks. Prolonged upper respiratory tract viral {DNA} shedding after skin lesion resolution challenged current infection prevention and control guidance. There is an urgent need for prospective studies of antivirals for this disease.

However, spatially explicit and thematically detailed quantitative analyses of land cover change over long time periods and at regional scale have been lacking. Here we present a change intensity analysis of a Landsat-based, visually interpreted, multi-date (1975, 2000, 2013) land cover dataset of West Africa, stratified into five bioclimatic sub-regions. Change intensities accelerated over time and increased from the arid to the sub-humid sub-regions, as did population densities. The area occupied by human-dominated land cover categories more than doubled from 493,000 km2 in 1975 to 1,121,000 km2 in 2013. Land cover change intensities within 10 km of new settlement locations exceeded the region-wide average by up to a factor of three, substantiating the significant role of population pressure as a force of change. The spatial patterns of the human footprint in West Africa, however, suggest that not only population pressure but also changing socioeconomic conditions and policies shape the complexity of land cover outcomes.},

	abstract = {The {COVID}-19 pandemic has given the study of virus evolution and ecology new relevance. Although viruses were first identified more than a century ago, we likely know less about their diversity than that of any other biological entity. Most documented animal viruses have been sampled from just two phyla — the Chordata and the Arthropoda — with a strong bias towards viruses that infect humans or animals of economic and social importance, often in association with strong disease phenotypes. Fortunately, the recent development of unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing is providing a richer view of the animal virome and shedding new light on virus evolution. In this Review, we explore our changing understanding of the diversity, composition and evolution of the animal virome. We outline the factors that determine the phylogenetic diversity and genomic structure of animal viruses on evolutionary timescales and show how this impacts assessment of the risk of disease emergence in the short term. We also describe the ongoing challenges in metagenomic analysis and outline key themes for future research. A central question is how major events in the evolutionary history of animals, such as the origin of the vertebrates and periodic mass extinction events, have shaped the diversity and evolution of the viruses they carry.},

Beyond disease specific research issues, a set of common macro-priorities and interventions were identified which, if implemented through a more integrated approach by countries, would have a significant impact on human health of the most marginalised populations characteristically dependent on livestock.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models ({SDMs}) based on statistical relationships between occurrence data and underlying environmental conditions are increasingly used to predict spatial patterns of biological invasions and prioritize locations for early detection and control of invasion outbreaks. However, invasive species distribution models ({iSDMs}) face special challenges because (i) they typically violate {SDM}'s assumption that the organism is in equilibrium with its environment, and (ii) species absence data are often unavailable or believed to be too difficult to interpret. This often leads researchers to generate pseudo-absences for model training or utilize presence-only methods, and to confuse the distinction between predictions of potential vs. actual distribution. We examined the hypothesis that true-absence data, when accompanied by dispersal constraints, improve prediction accuracy and ecological understanding of {iSDMs} that aim to predict the actual distribution of biological invasions. We evaluated the impact of presence-only, true-absence and pseudo-absence data on model accuracy using an extensive dataset on the distribution of the invasive forest pathogen Phytophthora ramorum in California. Two traditional presence/absence models (generalized linear model and classification trees) and two alternative presence-only models (ecological niche factor analysis and maximum entropy) were developed based on 890 field plots of pathogen occurrence and several climatic, topographic, host vegetation and dispersal variables. The effects of all three possible types of occurrence data on model performance were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) and omission/commission error rates. Results show that prediction of actual distribution was less accurate when we ignored true-absences and dispersal constraints. Presence-only models and models without dispersal information tended to over-predict the actual range of invasions. Models based on pseudo-absence data exhibited similar accuracies as presence-only models but produced spatially less feasible predictions. We suggest that true-absence data are a critical ingredient not only for accurate calibration but also for ecologically meaningful assessment of {iSDMs} that focus on predictions of actual distributions.},

	abstract = {Large-scale biodiversity databases have great potential for quantifying long-term trends of species, but they also bring many methodological challenges. Spatial bias of species occurrence records is well recognized. Yet, the dynamic nature of this spatial bias – how spatial bias has changed over time – has been largely overlooked. We examined the spatial bias of species occurrence records within multiple biodiversity databases in Germany and tested whether spatial bias in relation to land cover or land use (urban and protected areas) has changed over time. We focused our analyses on urban and protected areas as these represent two well-known correlates of sampling bias in biodiversity datasets. We found that the proportion of annual records from urban areas has increased over time while the proportion of annual records within protected areas has not consistently changed. Using simulations, we examined the implications of this changing sampling bias for estimation of long-term trends of species' distributions. When assessing biodiversity change, our findings suggest that the effects of spatial bias depend on how it affects sampling of the underlying land-use change drivers affecting species. Oversampling of regions undergoing the greatest degree of change, for instance near human settlements, might lead to overestimation of the trends of specialist species. For robust estimation of the long-term trends in species' distributions, analyses using species occurrence records may need to consider not only spatial bias, but also changes in the spatial bias through time.},

	abstract = {Predicting risk of zoonotic diseases, i.e., diseases shared by humans and animals, is often complicated by the population ecology of wildlife host(s). We here demonstrate how ecological knowledge of a disease system can be used for early prediction of human risk using Puumala hantavirus ({PUUV}) in bank voles (Myodes glareolus), which causes Nephropathia epidemica ({NE}) in humans, as a model system. Bank vole populations at northern latitudes exhibit multiannual fluctuations in density and spatial distribution, a phenomenon that has been studied extensively. Nevertheless, existing studies predict {NE} incidence only a few months before an outbreak. We used a time series on cyclic bank vole population density (1972–2013), their {PUUV} infection rates (1979–1986; 2003–2013), and {NE} incidence in Sweden (1990–2013). Depending on the relationship between vole density and infection prevalence (proportion of infected animals), either overall density of bank voles or the density of infected bank voles may be used to predict seasonal {NE} incidence. The density and spatial distribution of voles at density minima of a population cycle contribute to the early warning of {NE} risk later at its cyclic peak. When bank voles remain relatively widespread in the landscape during cyclic minima, {PUUV} can spread from a high baseline during a cycle, culminating in high prevalence in bank voles and potentially high {NE} risk during peak densities.},

: Liberia is endemic to Lassa fever ({LF}) and has the largest reported per capita incidence of {LF} patients in the West African region. Cases of the disease increased unprecedentedly in 2019 and 2020, characterized by a geographical drift in epidemiology and seasonal variation of occurrence. This study aims to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Lassa fever in Liberia from 2019 to 2020.
Method
: A retrospective study was conducted on cases of {LF} confirmed at the National Public Health Reference Laboratory from January 2019 to December 2020. Medical records were reviewed, and epidemiological and clinical data were collected in an organized manner. Descriptive and inferential statistics were carried out using Epi Info (version 7.2.5.0)
Result
: A total of 382 suspected {LF} cases were reported, of which 103 were laboratory-confirmed, yielding a case positivity rate of 27\% (103/382). The median age of the {LF} cases was 20 ({IGR}: 9-30) Children less than 18 years of age accounted for 40.8\% (42/103) of the cases and healthcare workers case constituted 7.7\% of the cases. Bong, Nimba and Grand Bass accounted for 87.4\% of the cases with cases in new counties like Lofa, Margibi and Grand Kru. Hemorrhage ({aOR}:10.2; 95\%{CI}: 3.11-33.81), patients who did not receive ribavirin ({aOR}: 4.4; 95\%{CI}: 1.12-17.57, p=0.034), and aged 40 years or older ({aOR}: 6.2; 95\%{CI}: 1.19-32.53, p=0.049) were associated with Lassa fever mortality.
Conclusion
: The {LF} cases in 2019 and 2020 had a high {CFR} and spread to new counties that had not previously been reporting {LF}. The disease occurred during most part of the raining season outside the usual dry season. There is urgent need to lower morbidity and mortality, improve early presentation to hospital and early initiation of appropriate medical care.},

	abstract = {Occupancy modelling is a common approach to assess species distribution patterns, while explicitly accounting for false absences in detection–nondetection data. Numerous extensions of the basic single-species occupancy model exist to model multiple species, spatial autocorrelation and to integrate multiple data types. However, development of specialized and computationally efficient software to incorporate such extensions, especially for large datasets, is scarce or absent. We introduce the {spOccupancy} R package designed to fit single-species and multi-species spatially explicit occupancy models. We fit all models within a Bayesian framework using Pólya-Gamma data augmentation, which results in fast and efficient inference. {spOccupancy} provides functionality for data integration of multiple single-species detection–nondetection datasets via a joint likelihood framework. The package leverages Nearest Neighbour Gaussian Processes to account for spatial autocorrelation, which enables spatially explicit occupancy modelling for potentially massive datasets (e.g. 1,000s–100,000s of sites). {spOccupancy} provides user-friendly functions for data simulation, model fitting, model validation (by posterior predictive checks), model comparison (using information criteria and k-fold cross-validation) and out-of-sample prediction. We illustrate the package's functionality via a vignette, simulated data analysis and two bird case studies. The {spOccupancy} package provides a user-friendly platform to fit a variety of single and multi-species occupancy models, making it straightforward to address detection biases and spatial autocorrelation in species distribution models even for large datasets.},

Although there are published maps for many emerging zoonotic viruses, it is unknown if there is agreement among different models or if they are concordant with national expert opinion. Therefore, we reviewed existing predictions for five high priority emerging zoonotic viruses with national experts in Cameroon to investigate these issues and determine how to make predictions more useful for national policymakers. Predictive maps relied primarily on environmental parameters and species distribution models. Rift Valley fever virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus predictions differed from national expert opinion, potentially because of local livestock movements. Our findings reveal that involving national experts could elicit additional data to improve predictions of emerging pathogens as well as help repackage predictions for policymakers.},

The lab-reared M. natalenesis proved to be highly susceptible to {LASV} isolates from geographically distinct regions of West Africa via multiple routes of exposure, with 50\% infectious doses of \&lt; 1 {TCID}50. Postinoculation, {LASV} Soromba-R established a systemic infection with no signs of clinical disease. Viral {RNA} was detected in all nine tissues examined with peak concentrations detected between days 7 and 14 postinfection within most organs. There was an overall trend toward clearance of virus within 40 days of infection in most organs. The exception is lung specimens, which retained positivity throughout the course of the 85-day study. Direct (contact) and indirect (fomite) transmission experiments demonstrated 40\% of experimentally infected M. natalensis were capable of transmitting {LASV} to naïve animals, with peak transmissibility occurring between 28 and 42 days post-inoculation. No differences in patterns of infection or transmission were noted between male and female experimentally infected rodents. Adult lab-reared M. natalensis are highly susceptible to genetically distinct {LASV} strains developing a temporary asymptomatic infection associated with virus shedding resulting in contact and fomite transmission within a cohort.},

The first reported case and management of Lassa fever in Plateau State occurred more than 50 years ago. We set out to undertake a three-year epidemiological review of {LF} cases in Plateau State, North Central Nigeria. This is a retrospective study of all confirmed {LF} cases in Plateau State between 2016 and 2018. Plateau state Lassa fever- Line list and patient case records were used to extract relevant data. Lassa {PCR} was carried out at the {NCDC} accredited Laboratory network. Data analysis was done using {STATA} version {SE}14.1. Forty-four persons (44) had confirmed {LF} over the examined period, 18 (41\%) in 2016, 15 (34\%) in 2017 and 11 (25\%) in 2018. The mean age was 29.7±14.6 years and 53\% were males. Sixty-six percent (66\%) of the patients resided in rural areas. It affected all local government areas ({LGA}) in the state except Pankshin, Jos East and Kanke {LGAs}. Twenty-five percent (25\%) of the cases occurred among underprivileged communities of Jos North and another 25\% in rural dwellers of Langtang North. Fifty-nine percent (59\%) of cases occurred during the 1st quarter, 27\% the 2nd quarter and 18\% the 3rd quarter of the year. The case fatality rate was 57\%. {LF} is endemic in Plateau State. Prevention strategies must be sustained year round and target the youth, urban and rural underprivileged communities. There is also need for case management improvement to reduce mortality.},

Here we show how radio-tracking and capture–mark–recapture data collated from wild rodent populations can be used to generate contact networks. 2. Both radio-tracking and capture–mark–recapture were undertaken simultaneously. Contact networks were derived and the following statistics estimated: mean-contact rate, edge distribution, connectance and centrality. 3. Capture–mark–recapture networks produced more informative and complete networks when the rodent density was high and radio-tracking produced more informative networks when the density was low. Different data collection methods provide more data when certain ecological characteristics of the population prevail. 4. Both sets of data produced networks with comparable edge (contact) distributions that were best described by a negative binomial distribution. Connectance and closeness were statistically different between the two data sets. Only betweenness was comparable. The differences between the networks have important consequences for the transmission of infectious diseases. Care should be taken when extrapolating social networks to transmission networks for inferring disease dynamics.},

	abstract = {Density-dependent shifts in population processes like territoriality, reproduction, dispersal, and parasite transmission are driven by changes in contacts between individuals. Despite this, surprisingly little is known about how contacts change with density, and thus the mechanisms driving density-dependent processes. A simple linear contact–density function is often assumed, but this is not based on a sound basis of empirical data. We addressed this question using a replicated, semi-natural experiment in which we measured contacts at feeding stations between multimammate mice, Mastomys natalensis, across ten distinct, linearly increasing densities between 10 and 272 animals/ha. Unexpectedly, unique contacts increased not linearly but sigmoidally with density, which we attribute to the species’ scramble competition mating system, small-scale dominance/avoidance and absence of territoriality. These results provide new insights into how species’ characteristics can relate to density-dependent changes in contacts, and the unexpected shape of the contact–density function warrants that density-dependence in ecological models, such as parasite transmission models, must be parameterized with care.},

At larger scales, and for bank voles at all scales, cowpox cases showed no spatial clustering beyond that expected from an association with host distribution. 6 Cowpox cases among wood mice showed strong evidence of temporal clustering beyond that of the host population, indicating short-lived outbreaks. No such effect was apparent among bank voles. 7 Significant space–time interaction among cowpox cases was detected at the hypothesized spatial and temporal scales in both host species. This suggests that the risk of transmission is concentrated locally. 8 Results are discussed in terms of transmission, including consideration of the appropriateness of distance and nearest-neighbour based clustering tests to infections transmitted by local density and frequency dependent mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Individual- and species-level heterogeneity in contact rates can alter the ability of a pathogen to invade a host community. Many pathogens have multiple modes of transmission—by direct or indirect contact. It is important to identify the role of heterogeneity in different types of transmission when managing the risk of disease spillover at the interface among different host species. We developed a network-based analysis to explore how individual- and species-level heterogeneity shape multi-mode contact networks. We applied this network-based approach to contact data from proximity loggers collected in a multi-species host community that contributes to the spillover of the disease bovine tuberculosis ({bTB}) to cattle populations in Michigan, {USA}. We used this approach to (a) quantify how individual- and species-level heterogeneity influence direct and indirect contacts in this system, (b) explore how management interventions to control spillovers, such as the installation of deer fences, can alter observed contact networks and c) predict the role that wildlife species have in maintaining {bTB} in the community. We found that individual- and species-level heterogeneity disproportionately influenced indirect and direct contact networks, with individual-level heterogeneity having a greater effect on indirect contact networks and species-level heterogeneity having a greater effect on direct contact networks. We also found that the installation of deer fences significantly reduced deer-specific indirect contacts. We used the results from our network analysis to show that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) could act as the sole reservoir host for {bTB} in this community with important implications for understanding past {bTB} dynamics and managing the persistence of {bTB} in the future. Synthesis and applications. Analyses of epidemiological networks rarely account for multiple modes of contact, which can lead to an incomplete understanding of how individual- and species-level heterogeneity affect disease transmission. The multi-mode, multi-species network analysis we develop in this study illustrates that individual- and species-level heterogeneity can play significantly different roles depending on the type of contact network considered. This has important implications when managing disease at the wildlife–livestock interface, where strategies may need to be multi-pronged to account for the variable role of heterogeneity on different modes of contact.},

However, this assumption does not always hold true; contact heterogeneity or preferential associations can have a substantial impact on the duration, size, and dynamics of epidemics. Contact heterogeneity has been readily adopted in epidemiological studies of humans, but has been less studied in wildlife. While contact network studies are becoming more common for wildlife, their methodologies, fundamental assumptions, host species, and parasites vary widely. The goal of this article is to review how contact networks have been used to study macro- and microparasite transmission in wildlife. The review will: (i) explain why contact heterogeneity is relevant for wildlife populations; (ii) explore theoretical and applied questions that contact networks have been used to answer; (iii) give an overview of unresolved methodological issues; and (iv) suggest improvements and future directions for contact network studies in wildlife.},

To understand disease persistence within these communities, it is essential to know the contribution each host species makes to parasite transmission and maintenance. However, quantifying those contributions is challenging. We present a conceptual framework for classifying multihost sharing, based on key thresholds for parasite persistence. We then develop a generalized technique to quantify each species' contribution to parasite persistence, allowing natural systems to be located within the framework. We illustrate this approach using data on gastrointestinal parasites circulating within rodent communities and show that, although many parasites infect several host species, parasite persistence is often driven by just one host species. In some cases, however, parasites require multiple host species for maintenance. Our approach provides a quantitative method for differentiating these cases using minimal reliance on system-specific parameters, enabling informed decisions about parasite management within poorly understood multihost communities.},

Through social network analysis, we understand that wild animal and livestock populations, including farmed fish and poultry, often have a heterogeneous contact structure owing to social structure or trade networks. Network modelling is a flexible tool used to capture the heterogeneous contacts of a population in order to test hypotheses about the mechanisms of disease transmission, simulate and predict disease spread, and test disease control strategies. This review highlights how to use animal contact data, including social networks, for network modelling, and emphasizes that researchers should have a pathogen of interest in mind before collecting or using contact data. This paper describes the rising popularity of network approaches for understanding transmission dynamics in wild animal and livestock populations; discusses the common mismatch between contact networks as measured in animal behaviour and relevant parasites to match those networks; and highlights knowledge gaps in how to collect and analyse contact data. Opportunities for the future include increased attention to experiments, pathogen genetic markers and novel computational tools.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneities within disease hosts suggest that not all individuals have the same probability of transmitting disease or becoming infected. This heterogeneity is thought to be due to dissimilarity in susceptibility and exposure among hosts. As such, it has been proposed that many host–pathogen systems follow the general pattern whereby a small fraction of the population accounts for a large fraction of the pathogen transmission. This disparity in transmission dynamics is often referred to as ‘20/80 Rule’, i.e. approximately 20 per cent of the hosts are responsible for 80 per cent of pathogen transmission. We investigated the role of heterogeneity in contact rates among potential hosts of a directly transmitted pathogen by examining Sin Nombre virus ({SNV}) in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using foraging arenas and powder marking, we documented contacts between wild deer mice in Great Basin Desert, central Utah. Our findings demonstrated heterogeneity among deer mice, both in frequency and in duration of contacts with other deer mice. Contact dynamics appear to follow the general pattern that a minority of the population accounts for a majority of the contacts. We found that 20 per cent of individuals in the population were responsible for roughly 80 per cent of the contacts observed. Larger-bodied individuals appear to be the functional group with the greatest {SNV} transmission potential. Contrary to our predictions, transmission potential was not influenced by breeding condition or sex.},

	abstract = {Background The management of many pathogens, which are of concern to humans and their livestock, is complicated by the pathogens' ability to cross-infect multiple host species, including wildlife. This has major implications for the management of such diseases, since the dynamics of infection are dependent on the rates of both intra- and inter-specific transmission. However, the difficulty of studying transmission networks in free-living populations means that the relative opportunities for intra- versus inter-specific disease transmission have not previously been demonstrated empirically within any wildlife-livestock disease system. Methodology/Principal Findings Using recently-developed proximity data loggers, we quantify both intra-and inter-specific contacts in a wildlife-livestock disease system, using bovine tuberculosis ({bTB}) in badgers and cattle in the {UK} as our example. We assess the connectedness of individuals within the networks in order to identify whether there are certain ‘high-risk’ individuals or groups of individuals for disease transmission within and between species. Our results show that contact patterns in both badger and cattle populations vary widely, both between individuals and over time. We recorded only infrequent interactions between badger social groups, although all badgers fitted with data loggers were involved in these inter-group contacts. Contacts between badgers and cattle occurred more frequently than contacts between different badger groups. Moreover, these inter-specific contacts involved those individual cows, which were highly connected within the cattle herd. Conclusions/Significance This work represents the first continuous time record of wildlife-host contacts for any free-living wildlife-livestock disease system. The results highlight the existence of specific individuals with relatively high contact rates in both livestock and wildlife populations, which have the potential to act as hubs in the spread of disease through complex contact networks. Targeting testing or preventive measures at high-contact groups and individuals within livestock populations would enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of disease management strategies.},

	abstract = {Wild animals are the source of many pathogens of livestock and humans. Concerns about the potential transmission of economically important and zoonotic diseases from wildlife have led to increased surveillance at the livestock-wildlife interface. Knowledge of the types, frequency and duration of contacts between livestock and wildlife is necessary to identify risk factors for disease transmission and to design possible mitigation strategies. Observing the behaviour of many wildlife species is challenging due to their cryptic nature and avoidance of humans, meaning there are relatively few studies in this area. Further, a consensus on the definition of what constitutes a 'contact' between wildlife and livestock is lacking. A systematic review was conducted to investigate which livestock-wildlife contacts have been studied and why, as well as the methods used to observe each species. Over 30,000 publications were screened, of which 122 fulfilled specific criteria for inclusion in the analysis. The majority of studies examined cattle contacts with badgers or with deer; studies involving wild pig contacts with cattle or with domestic pigs were the next most frequent. There was a range of observational methods including motion-activated cameras and global positioning system collars. As a result of the wide variation and lack of consensus in the definitions of direct and indirect contacts, we developed a unified framework to define livestock-wildlife contacts that is sufficiently flexible to be applied to most wildlife and livestock species for non-vector-borne diseases. We hope this framework will help standardise the collection and reporting of contact data; a valuable step towards being able to compare the efficacy of wildlife-livestock observation methods. In doing so, it may aid the development of better disease transmission models and improve the design and effectiveness of interventions to reduce or prevent disease transmission.},

We used this framework to quantify the contributions of host species composition and habitat patch identity on the persistence of an amphibian pathogen across the landscape. By sampling over 11 000 hosts of six amphibian species, we found that a single host species could maintain the pathogen in 91\% of observed metacommunities. Moreover, this dominant maintenance species contributed, on average, twice as much to landscape-level pathogen persistence compared to the most influential source patch in a metacommunity. Our analysis demonstrates substantial inequality in how species and patches contribute to pathogen persistence, with important implications for targeted disease management.},

Yet, little is known about the factors shaping contact networks in many wildlife species and how wildlife management actions might affect contact networks. Wild pigs in North America are an invasive, socially structured species that pose a health concern for domestic swine given their ability to transmit numerous devastating diseases such as African swine fever ({ASF}). Using proximity loggers and {GPS} data from 48 wild pigs in Florida and South Carolina, {USA}, we employed a probabilistic framework to estimate weighted contact networks. We determined the effects of sex, social group and spatial distribution (monthly home-range overlap and distance) on wild pig contact. We also estimated the impacts of management-induced perturbations on contact and inferred their effects on {ASF} establishment in wild pigs with simulation. Social group membership was the primary factor influencing contacts. Between-group contacts depended primarily on space use characteristics, with fewer contacts among groups separated by {\textgreater}2 km and no contacts among groups {\textgreater}4 km apart within a month. Modelling {ASF} dynamics on the contact network demonstrated that indirect contacts resulting from baiting (a typical method of attracting wild pigs or game species to a site to enhance recreational hunting) increased the risk of disease establishment by 33\% relative to direct contact. Low-intensity population reduction ({\textless}5.9\% of the population) had no detectable impact on contact structure but reduced predicted {ASF} establishment risk relative to no population reduction. We demonstrate an approach for understanding the relative role of spatial, social and individual-level characteristics in shaping contact networks and predicting their effects on disease establishment risk, thus providing insight for optimizing disease control in spatially and socially structured wildlife species.},

Uncertainty remains about the epidemic dynamics of diseases being introduced on farms with more than one susceptible host species. Here, we describe multi-host contact networks and elucidate the potential of disease spread through farms with multiple hosts. Four years of between-farm animal movement among all farms of a Brazilian state were described through a static and monthly snapshot of network representations. We developed a stochastic multilevel model to simulate scenarios in which infection was seeded into single host and multi-host farms to quantify disease spread potential, and simulate network-based control actions used to evaluate the reduction of secondarily infected farms. We showed that the swine network was more connected than cattle and small ruminants in both the static and monthly snapshots. The small ruminant network was highly fragmented, however, contributed to interconnecting farms, with other hosts acting as intermediaries throughout the networks. When a single host was initially infected, secondary infections were observed across farms with all other species. Our stochastic multi-host model demonstrated that targeting the top 3.25\% of the farms ranked by degree reduced the number of secondarily infected farms. The results of the simulation highlight the importance of considering multi-host dynamics and contact networks while designing surveillance and preparedness control strategies against pathogens known to infect multiple species.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of Lassa virus ({LASV}) infections in rodent reservoirs and their endemic human caseloads remain poorly understood. During the endemic period, human infections are believed to be associated with the seasonal migration of Mastomys natalensis, thought to be the primary reservoir that triggers multiple spillovers of {LASV} to humans. It has become imperative to improve {LASV} diagnosis in rodents while updating their prevalence in two regions of Lassa fever endemicity in Nigeria. Rodents (total, 942) were trapped in Ondo (531) and Ebonyi (411) states between October 2018 and April 2020 for detection of {LASV} using various tissues. Overall, the {LASV} prevalence was 53.6\%. The outbreak area sampled in Ondo had three and two times higher capture success and {LASV} prevalence, respectively, than Ebonyi State. This correlated with the higher number of annual cases of Lassa fever ({LF}) in Ondo State versus Ebonyi State. All rodent genera (Mastomys, Rattus, Crocidura, Mus, and Tatera) captured in both states showed slightly variable {LASV} positivity, with Rattus spp. being the most predominantly infected (77.3\%) rodents in Ondo State versus Mastomys spp. (41.6\%) in Ebonyi State. The tissues with the highest {LASV} positivity were the kidneys, spleen, and testes. The finding of a relatively high {LASV} prevalence in all of the rodent genera captured highlights the complex interspecies transmission dynamics of {LASV} infections in the reservoirs and their potential association with increased environmental contact, as well as the risk of zoonotic spillover in these communities, which have the highest prevalence of Lassa fever in Nigeria. {IMPORTANCE} Our findings show the highest {LASV} positivity in small rodents ever recorded and the first direct detection of {LASV} in Tatera spp. Our findings also indicate the abundance of {LASV}-infected small rodents in houses, with probable interspecies transmission through vertical and horizontal coitus routes. Consequently, we suggest that the abundance of different reservoir species for {LASV} may fuel the epizootic outbreaks of {LF} in affected human communities.

	abstract = {Studying the social behaviour of small or cryptic species often relies on constructing networks from sparse point-based observations of individuals (e.g. live trapping data). A common approach assumes that individuals that have been detected sequentially in the same trapping location will also be more likely to have come into indirect and/or direct contact. However, there is very little guidance on how much data are required for making robust networks from such data. In this study, we highlight that sequential trap sharing networks broadly capture shared space use (and, hence, the potential for contact) and that it may be more parsimonious to directly model shared space use. We first use empirical data to show that characteristics of how animals use space can help us to establish new ways to model the potential for individuals to come into contact. We then show that a method that explicitly models individuals’ home ranges and subsequent overlap in space among individuals (spatial overlap networks) requires fewer data for inferring observed networks that are more strongly correlated with the true shared space use network (relative to sequential trap sharing networks). Furthermore, we show that shared space use networks based on estimating spatial overlap are also more powerful for detecting biological effects. Finally, we discuss when it is appropriate to make inferences about social interactions from shared space use. Our study confirms the potential for using sparse trapping data from cryptic species to address a range of important questions in ecology and evolution.},

	abstract = {Summary. Spatial replication is a common theme in count surveys of animals. Such surveys often generate sparse count data from which it is difficult to estimate population size while formally accounting for detection probability. In this article, I describe a class of models (N-mixture models) which allow for estimation of population size from such data. The key idea is to view site-specific population sizes, N, as independent random variables distributed according to some mixing distribution (e.g., Poisson). Prior parameters are estimated from the marginal likelihood of the data, having integrated over the prior distribution for N. Carroll and Lombard (1985, Journal of American Statistical Association80, 423–426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are fixed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on N that is exploited by the N-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, confidence interval coverage) of the N-mixture estimator compared to the Caroll and Lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially different estimates of abundance as a consequence.},

However, changes in climate and land use will lead to opportunities for viral sharing among previously geographically isolated species of wildlife3,4. In some cases, this will facilitate zoonotic spillover—a mechanistic link between global environmental change and disease emergence. Here we simulate potential hotspots of future viral sharing, using a phylogeographical model of the mammal–virus network, and projections of geographical range shifts for 3,139 mammal species under climate-change and land-use scenarios for the year 2070. We predict that species will aggregate in new combinations at high elevations, in biodiversity hotspots, and in areas of high human population density in Asia and Africa, causing the cross-species transmission of their associated viruses an estimated 4,000 times. Owing to their unique dispersal ability, bats account for the majority of novel viral sharing and are likely to share viruses along evolutionary pathways that will facilitate future emergence in humans. Notably, we find that this ecological transition may already be underway, and holding warming under 2 °C within the twenty-first century will not reduce future viral sharing. Our findings highlight an urgent need to pair viral surveillance and discovery efforts with biodiversity surveys tracking the range shifts of species, especially in tropical regions that contain the most zoonoses and are experiencing rapid warming.},

	abstract = {Background
In September 2017, Nigeria experienced a large outbreak of human monkeypox ({HMPX}). In this study, we report the outbreak experience and response in the Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital ({NDUTH}), Bayelsa state, where the index case and majority of suspected cases were reported.

Methods
In a cross-sectional study between September 25th and 31st December 2017, we reviewed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of all suspected and confirmed cases of {HMPX} seen at the {NDUTH} and appraised the plans, activities and challenges of the hospital in response to the outbreak based on documented observations of the hospital’s infection control committee ({IPC}). Monkeypox cases were defined using the interim national guidelines as provided by the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control ({NCDC}).

Results
Of 38 suspected cases of {HMPX}, 18(47.4\%) were laboratory confirmed, 3(7.9\%) were probable, while 17 (18.4\%) did not fit the case definition for {HMPX}. Majority of the confirmed/probable cases were adults (80.9\%) and males (80.9\%). There was concomitant chicken pox, syphilis and {HIV}-1 infections in two confirmed cases and a case of nosocomial infection in one healthcare worker ({HCW}). The hospital established a make-shift isolation ward for case management, constituted a {HMPX} response team and provided {IPC} resources. At the outset, some {HCWs} were reluctant to participate in the outbreak and others avoided suspected patients. Some patients and their family members experienced stigma and discrimination and there were cases of refusal of isolation. Repeated trainings and collaborative efforts by all stakeholders addressed some of these challenges and eventually led to successful containment of the outbreak.

Conclusion
While the 2017 outbreak of human monkeypox in Nigeria was contained, our report reveals gaps in outbreak response that could serve as lessons to other hospitals to strengthen epidemic preparedness and response activities in the hospital setting.},

It is predicted that monkeypox virus will continue to be introduced into human communities from animal sources, and that the average magnitude and duration of monkeypox epidemics will increase as vaccine-derived protection declines in the population. On the other hand, current evidence Indicates that the virus is appreciably less transmissible than was smallpox, and that it will not persist In human communities, even in the total absence of vaccination.

In June–July 2011, we investigated mortality in ducks, geese and chickens with suspected H5N1 infection in a north-eastern district of the country to identify the aetiologic agent and extent of the outbreak and identify possible associated human infections. We surveyed households and farms with affected poultry flocks in six villages in Netrokona district and collected cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs from sick birds and tissue samples from dead poultry. We conducted a survey in three of these villages to identify suspected human influenza-like illness cases and collected nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. We tested all swabs by real-time {RT}-{PCR}, sequenced cultured viruses, and examined tissue samples by histopathology and immunohistochemistry to detect and characterize influenza virus infection. In the six villages, among the 240 surveyed households and 11 small-scale farms, 61\% (1789/2930) of chickens, 47\% (4816/10 184) of ducks and 73\% (358/493) of geese died within 14 days preceding the investigation. Of 70 sick poultry swabbed, 80\% (56/70) had detectable {RNA} for influenza A/H5, including 89\% (49/55) of ducks, 40\% (2/5) of geese and 50\% (5/10) of chickens. We isolated virus from six of 25 samples; sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene of these six isolates indicated clade 2.3.2.1a of H5N1 virus. Histopathological changes and immunohistochemistry staining of avian influenza viral antigens were recognized in the brain, pancreas and intestines of ducks and chickens. We identified ten human cases showing signs compatible with influenza-like illness; four were positive for influenza A/H3; however, none were positive for influenza A/H5. The recently introduced H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1a virus caused unusually high mortality in ducks and geese. Heightened surveillance in poultry is warranted to guide appropriate diagnostic testing and detect novel influenza strains.},

The epidemiological situation of West Nile fever in Europe is heterogeneous. No model of surveillance and monitoring fits all, hence this article merely encourages countries to implement the integrated approach that meets their needs. Integration of surveillance and monitoring activities conducted by the public health authorities, the animal health authorities and the authorities in charge of vector surveillance and control should improve efficiency and save resources by implementing targeted measures. The creation of a formal interagency working group is identified as a crucial step towards integration. Blood safety is a key incentive for public health authorities to allocate sufficient resources for {WNV} surveillance, while the facts that an effective vaccine is available for horses and that most infected animals remain asymptomatic make the disease a lesser priority for animal health authorities. The examples described here can support other European countries wishing to strengthen their {WNV} surveillance or preparedness, and also serve as a model for surveillance and monitoring of other (vector-borne) zoonotic infections.},

Molecular investigations showed the viral genomes to be similar to that of the Togo strain, which is genetically very different from other known strains and confirms the existence of a new lineage. Endemic circulation of Lassa virus in a new territory and the genetic diversity thus confirm that this virus represents a growing threat for West African people. Given the divergence of the Benin strain from the prototypic Josiah Sierra Leone strain frequently used to generate vaccine candidates, the efficacy of vaccine candidates should also be demonstrated with this strain.},

In the last few decades, a global integrative concept, often referred to as ‘One Health’, has been strongly endorsed. Surveillance and monitoring efforts are major components for effective disease prevention and control. As human health and animal health are inextricably linked, it is assumed that a cross-sectoral data interpretation of zoonotic disease information will improve their prevention, prediction and control. To provide an overview of existing systems throughout the world which integrate information from humans and animals on zoonotic diseases, a literature review was conducted. Twenty projects were identified and described regarding their concepts and realization. They all vary widely depending on their surveillance purpose, their structure and the source of information they use. What they have in common is that they quite often use data which have already been collected for another purpose. Therefore, the challenges of how to make use of such secondary data are of great interest.},

We review what is known about the pathogens that emerge, the hosts that they originate in, and the factors that drive their emergence. We discuss challenges to their control and new efforts to predict pandemics, target surveillance to the most crucial interfaces, and identify prevention strategies. New mathematical modelling, diagnostic, communications, and informatics technologies can identify and report hitherto unknown microbes in other species, and thus new risk assessment approaches are needed to identify microbes most likely to cause human disease. We lay out a series of research and surveillance opportunities and goals that could help to overcome these challenges and move the global pandemic strategy from response to pre-emption.},

It is currently not known how climate and land use changes could affect the endemic area of this virus, currently limited to parts of West Africa. By exploring the environmental data associated with virus occurrence using ecological niche modelling, we show how temperature, precipitation and the presence of pastures determine ecological suitability for virus circulation. Based on projections of climate, land use, and population changes, we find that regions in Central and East Africa will likely become suitable for Lassa virus over the next decades and estimate that the total population living in ecological conditions that are suitable for Lassa virus circulation may drastically increase by 2070. By analysing geotagged viral genomes using spatially-explicit phylogeography and simulating virus dispersal, we find that in the event of Lassa virus being introduced into a new suitable region, its spread might remain spatially limited over the first decades.

Like Ebola virus, Lassa virus ({LASV}) can cause hemorrhagic fever with high case fatality rates. We generated a genomic catalog of almost 200 {LASV} sequences from clinical and rodent reservoir samples. We show that whereas the 2013-2015 {EVD} epidemic is fueled by human-to-human transmissions, {LASV} infections mainly result from reservoir-to-human infections. We elucidated the spread of {LASV} across West Africa and show that this migration was accompanied by changes in {LASV} genome abundance, fatality rates, codon adaptation, and translational efficiency. By investigating intrahost evolution, we found that mutations accumulate in epitopes of viral surface proteins, suggesting selection for immune escape. This catalog will serve as a foundation for the development of vaccines and diagnostics. {VIDEO} {ABSTRACT}. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Lassa virus causes hemorrhagic fever in West Africa. Previously, we demonstrated by {PCR} screening that only the multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, hosts Lassa virus in Guinea. In the present study, we used the same specimen collection from 17 villages in Coastal, Upper, and Forest Guinea to investigate the Lassa virus serology in the rodent population. The aim was to determine the dynamics of antibody development in M. natalensis and to detect potential spillover infections in other rodent species. Immunoglobulin G ({IgG}) antibody screening was performed using the indirect immunofluorescence assay with the Guinean Lassa virus strain Bantou 289 as antigen. The overall seroprevalence was 8\% (129/1551) with the following rodents testing positive: 109 M. natalensis, seven Mastomys erythroleucus, four Lemniscomys striatus, four Praomys daltoni, three Mus minutoides, and two Praomys rostratus. Nearly all of them (122/129) originated from Bantou, Tanganya, and Gbetaya, where Lassa virus is highly endemic in M. natalensis. The antibody seroprevalence in M. natalensis from this high-endemic area (27\%; 108/396) depended on the village, habitat, host age, and host abundance. A main positive factor was age; the maximum seroprevalence reached 50\% in older animals. Our data fit with a model implicating that most M. natalensis rodents become horizontally infected, clear the virus within a period significantly shorter than their life span, and develop antibodies. In addition, the detection of antibodies in other species trapped in the habitats of M. natalensis suggests spillover infections.},

Quality and hygiene factors of households were assessed to determine possible risk factors for household rodent infestation and occurrence of Lassa fever.

Thirty-nine percent of the Mastomys in case houses were viremic, compared to 3.7\% in control houses. Human antibody prevalence in case houses was 30\%, compared to 20\% in non-case houses (P less than 0.05, chi-square test, df = 2).

Standard model checking and selection methods are often unreliable in this setting and there is only limited guidance in the ecological literature for this class of models.

Using a stage-structured host-pathogen model parameterized and cross-validated from a unique 15-year data set, we show how stochastic population fluctuations can lead to predictable dynamics of {SNV} in deer mice. Significant variation in host abundance and the basic reproductive number of the virus results in intermittent crossing of the critical host population density necessary for {SNV} endemicity and frequent local extinctions. When environmental conditions favor growth of the host population above the threshold, host–pathogen interactions lead to delayed density dependence in reservoir prevalence.

	abstract = {Abstract
          Zoonotic diseases are an increasingly important source of human infectious diseases, and host pathogen richness of reservoir host species is a critical driver of spill-over risk. Population-level traits of hosts such as population size, host density and geographic range size have all been shown to be important determinants of host pathogen richness. However, empirically identifying the independent influences of these traits has proven difficult as many of these traits directly depend on each other. Here we develop a mechanistic, metapopulation, susceptible-infected-recovered model to identify the independent influences of these population-level traits on the ability of a newly evolved pathogen to invade and persist in host populations in the presence of an endemic pathogen. We use bats as a case study as they are highly social and an important source of zoonotic disease. We show that larger populations and group sizes had a greater influence on the chances of pathogen invasion and persistence than increased host density or the number of groups. As anthropogenic change affects these traits to different extents, this increased understanding of how traits independently determine pathogen richness will aid in predicting future zoonotic spill-over risk.},

Early signs, if detected, can include depression, inappetence, colic or mild respiratory signs. All unvaccinated ill horses in areas where flying foxes exist, may potentially be infected with {HeV}, posing a significant risk to the veterinary community. Equivac® {HeV} vaccine has been fully registered in Australia since 2015 (and under an Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority special permit since 2012) for immunization of horses against {HeV} and is the most effective and direct solution to prevent disease transmission to horses and protect humans. No {HeV} vaccinated horse has tested positive for {HeV} infection. There is no registered vaccine to prevent, or therapeutics to treat, {HeV} infection in humans. Previous equine {HeV} outbreaks tended to cluster in winter overlapping with the foaling season (August to December), when veterinarians and horse owners have frequent close contact with horses and their bodily fluids, increasing the chance of zoonotic disease transmission. The most southerly case was detected in 2019 in the Upper Hunter region in New South Wales, which is Australia's Thoroughbred horse breeding capital. Future spillover events are predicted to move further south and inland in Queensland and New South Wales, aligning with the moving distribution of the main reservoir hosts. Here we (1) review {HeV} epidemiology and climate change predicted infection dynamics, (2) present a biosecurity protocol for veterinary clinics and hospitals to adopt, and (3) describe diagnostic tests currently available and those under development.

We discuss ways by which these two hypotheses might be tested using a combination of ecological and virological approaches, and how this may provide novel control and prevention strategies.},

	abstract = {Theory predicts that increasing biodiversity will dilute the risk of infectious diseases under certain conditions and will amplify disease risk under others. Yet, few empirical studies demonstrate amplification. This contrast may occur because few studies have considered the multivariate nature of disease risk, which includes richness and abundance of parasites with different transmission modes. By combining a multivariate statistical model developed for biodiversity–ecosystem–multifunctionality with an extensive field manipulation of host (plant) richness, composition and resource supply to hosts, we reveal that (i) host richness alone could not explain most changes in disease risk, and (ii) shifting host composition allowed disease amplification, depending on parasite transmission mode. Specifically, as predicted from theory, the effect of host diversity on parasite abundance differed for microbes (more density-dependent transmission) and insects (more frequency-dependent transmission). Host diversity did not influence microbial parasite abundance, but nearly doubled insect parasite abundance, and this amplification effect was attributable to variation in host composition. Parasite richness was reduced by resource addition, but only in species-rich host communities. Overall, this study demonstrates that multiple drivers, related to both host community and parasite characteristics, can influence disease risk. Furthermore, it provides a framework for evaluating multivariate disease risk in other systems.},

	abstract = {While the importance of changes in host biodiversity for disease risk continues to gain empirical support, the influence of natural variation in parasite diversity on epidemiological outcomes remains largely overlooked. Here, we combined field infection data from 2,191 amphibian hosts representing 158 parasite assemblages with mechanistic experiments to evaluate the influence of parasite richness on both parasite transmission and host fitness. Using a guild of larval trematode parasites (six species) and an amphibian host, our experiments contrasted the effects of parasite richness vs. composition, observed vs. randomized assemblages, and additive vs. replacement designs. Consistent with the dilution effect hypothesis extended to intrahost diversity, increases in parasite richness reduced overall infection success, including infections by the most virulent parasite. However, the effects of parasite richness on host growth and survival were context dependent; pathology increased when parasites were administered additively, even when the presence of the most pathogenic species was held constant, but decreased when added species replaced or reduced virulent species, emphasizing the importance of community composition and assembly. These results were similar or stronger when community structures were weighted by their observed frequencies in nature. The field data also revealed the highly nested structure of parasite assemblages, with virulent species generally occupying basal positions, suggesting that increases in parasite richness and antagonism in nature will decrease virulent infections. Our findings emphasize the importance of parasite biodiversity and coinfection in affecting epidemiological responses and highlight the value of integrating research on biodiversity and community ecology for understanding infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to 2λ/n, where λ is the real log canonical threshold and n is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.},

Symptomatic disease is expected to occur in 20\% of those infected and transmission typically occurs from viral spillover from rodent hosts. The combination of limited access to diagnostics and healthcare means the true burden of this disease is unknown.The case fatality rate among confirmed, probable and possible cases of Lassa fever in endemic regions is expected to be ≈15\%. Here, annual reported cases and deaths have been used to estimate the case fatality rate, using three subsets of available data, to understand the scale of underreporting of severe human cases.The literature review produced 38 records of cases and fatalities, comprising 5230 reported cases and 1482 reported deaths in seven countries. The estimated case fatality rate ranges from 16.5 to 25.6\% (standard deviation 11.5–32.2). The expected number of severe cases between 2012 and 2022 is 8995, with current reported numbers 58\% of what is expected.This analysis highlights current uncertainty and systemic underreporting of the morbidity and mortality burden of Lassa fever in its endemic region and must be considered when discussing the epidemiology of this neglected tropical disease.},

It is often difficult to study these patterns in an integrated way, however, especially because long-term data are needed but not readily available. In this paper, we investigate effects of population density, season and breeding status on home range patterns of the promiscuous rodent Mastomys natalensis using monthly capture-mark-recapture data collected over 17 years in a 3-ha grid. Home ranges were estimated using minimum convex polygons bounded by trap locations, and home range overlap and visitation rates were calculated as a measure of territoriality. As higher population densities coincide with increased resource availability, we predicted that home range sizes would correlate negatively with density. Furthermore, as M. natalensis is promiscuous and population densities are generally high, we predicted that territoriality would be low, and home range overlap would therefore be high. Contrary to expectations the home ranges of female adults increased with population density, although those of male adults and subadults followed the expected decrease. Home range overlap and visitation rates were generally high, and increased significantly with population density. More importantly, they were never lower than those of simulated datasets consisting of randomly moved home ranges. These results therefore suggest that M. natalensis displays a complete lack of territoriality that is rarely seen in small mammals but still meets predictions based on knowledge of density and mating system.},

	abstract = {{\textless}br{\textgreater}\textit{Background \& objectives:} Lassa fever has been endemic in Nigeria since 1969. The rodent \textit{Mastomys natalensis} has been widely claimed to be the reservoir host of the Lassa virus. This study was designed to investigate the distribution of species of rodents in three states (Edo, Delta and Bayelsa) of Nigeria and to determine the prevalence of Lassa virus amongst trapped rodents in the selected states.{\textless}br{\textgreater}\textit{Methods:} Rodents were trapped during November 2015 to October 2016 from the three states in South-South region of Nigeria. Total {RNA} was extracted from the blood collected from the trapped rodents. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}) was used to confirm the presence of Lassa virus in the rodents.{\textless}br{\textgreater}\textit{Results:} The results revealed that six species of rodents were predominantly present in these geographical locations. \textit{Mus musculus} (39.4\%) had the highest prevalence, closely followed by \textit{Rattus rattus} (36.1\%), \textit{R. fuscipus} (20.3\%), \textit{M. natalensis} (2\%), \textit{Myosoricinae soricidae} (1.2\%) and \textit{R. norvegicus} (1\%). The overall positivity (carrier rate) of Lassa virus was 1.6\% amongst the 1500 rodents caught in the three states. In Edo and Delta States, the {RT}-{PCR} results showed presence of Lassa virus in \textit{R rattus, M. musculus} and \textit{M. natalensis}. On the other hand, only \textit{M. natalensis} was detected with the virus, amongst the species of rodents caught in Bayelsa State. \textit{M. natalensis} recorded the highest Lassa virus among rodents trapped in Edo (87\%), Delta (50\%) and Bayelsa (11\%) States respectively.{\textless}br{\textgreater}\textit{Interpretation \& conclusion:} The rather low Lassa virus positive among rodents in Bayelsa State of Nigeria may explain the absence of reports of outbreak of Lassa fever over the past 48 yr in the state. The results also confirmed that apart from \textit{Mastomys natalensis}, other rodents such as \textit{Rattus rattus} and \textit{Mus musculus} may also serve as reservoirs for Lassa virus. From the findings of this cross-sectional study, it was concluded that a more comprehensive study on rodents as reservoir host, need to be undertaken across the entire states of Nigeria, for better understanding of the epidemiology and endemicity of Lassa fever.{\textless}br{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Small mammals are important to the functioning of ecological communities with changes to their abundances used to track impacts of environmental change. While capture–recapture estimates of absolute abundance are preferred, indices of abundance continue to be used in cases of limited sampling, rare species with little data, or unmarked individuals. Improvement to indices can be achieved by calibrating them to absolute abundance but their reliability across years, sites, or species is unclear. To evaluate this, we used the {US} National Ecological Observatory Network capture–recapture data for 63 small mammal species over 46 sites from 2013 to 2019. We generated 17,155 absolute abundance estimates using capture–recapture analyses and compared these to two standard abundance indices, and three types of calibrated indices. We found that neither raw abundance indices nor index calibrations were reliable approximations of absolute abundance, with raw indices less correlated with absolute abundance than index calibrations (raw indices overall R2 \&lt; 0.5, index calibration overall R2 \&gt; 0.6). Performance of indices and index calibrations varied by species, with those having higher and less variable capture probabilities performing best. We conclude that indices and index calibration methods should be used with caution with a count of individuals being the best index to use, especially if it can be calibrated with capture probability. None of the indices we tested should be used for comparing different species due to high variation in capture probabilities. Hierarchical models that allow for sharing of capture probabilities over species or plots (i.e., joint-likelihood models) may offer a better solution to mitigate the cost and effort of large-scale small mammal sampling while still providing robust estimates of abundance.},

	shorttitle = {Unbiased Sampling for Rodents and Other Small Mammals},
	abstract = {Live-trapping of urban rodents and other small mammals poses several challenges for researchers and pest control professionals ({PMPs}). Most traps are novel to the natural environment and elicit neophobic, or trap-shy, behaviors. Thus, animals captured in traditional traps may either be the least risk-averse, or most desperate. Consequently, individuals of the lowest social ranks, those in poorest health, and the slowest learners are more likely to be captured. This is problematic for research because non-random samples may lead to over-generalization and false conclusions. To address these problems, we developed an inconspicuous, hanging live-trap prototype. In addition to being hard to detect, the trap enables setting several parameters of animal movement and detection before the trap is triggered. The neophobic reaction could then be significantly reduced because animals do not need to enter any trap-like objects—instead they move and feed on a familiar surface. At a time predefined by the user, the triggering mechanism drops a transparent cover over the animal, preventing it from fleeing and enabling either transport to the laboratory, mark-and-release or disposal. Here, we report our initial purpose, design and preliminary results. Animals triggered the trap 34 times during our 1-month preliminary assessment. During this time, 32 individuals were captured (25 Norway rats and 7 house mice) for a 94\% catch rate. Video surveillance revealed no obvious signs of non-random sampling as all trapped rats were representative of a broad range of sizes and ages. There were no signs of low social status (e.g., scar markings, parasitism, or poor health). Importantly, we found a low latency following capture, as released animals showed no instances of increased exploratory or cautious behaviors such as rearing or sniffing, near the hidden traps. More monitoring of this design is needed before future conclusions can be drawn. However, these results should encourage a full range of experimental trials from neuroscientists, urban ecologists, pest control professionals ({PMPs}) and conservationists who seek randomized samples or who work with trap-shy species.},

	abstract = {Canine rabies transmission was interrupted in N’Djaména, Chad, following two mass vaccination campaigns. However, after nine months cases resurged with re-establishment of endemic rabies transmission to pre-intervention levels. Previous analyses investigated district level spatial heterogeneity of vaccination coverage, and dog density; and importation, identifying the latter as the primary factor for rabies resurgence. Here we assess the impact of individual level heterogeneity on outbreak probability, effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and likely time to resurgence after a campaign. Geo-located contact sensors recorded the location and contacts of 237 domestic dogs in N’Djaména over a period of 3.5 days. The contact network data showed that urban dogs are socially related to larger communities and constrained by the urban architecture. We developed a network generation algorithm that extrapolates this empirical contact network to networks of large dog populations and applied it to simulate rabies transmission in N’Djaména. The model predictions aligned well with the rabies incidence data. Using the model we demonstrated, that major outbreaks are prevented when at least 70\% of dogs are vaccinated. The probability of a minor outbreak also decreased with increasing vaccination coverage, but reached zero only when coverage was near total. Our results suggest that endemic rabies in N’Djaména may be explained by a series of importations with subsequent minor outbreaks. We show that highly connected dogs hold a critical role in transmission and that targeted vaccination of such dogs would lead to more efficient vaccination campaigns.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic illness responsible for disease outbreaks across West Africa. It is a zoonosis, with the primary reservoir species identified as the Natal multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis. The host is distributed across sub-Saharan Africa while the virus' range appears to be restricted to West Africa. The majority of infections result from interactions between the animal reservoir and human populations, although secondary transmission between humans can occur, particularly in hospital settings.Using a species distribution model, the locations of confirmed human and animal infections with Lassa virus ({LASV}) were used to generate a probabilistic surface of zoonotic transmission potential across sub-Saharan Africa.Our results predict that 37.7 million people in 14 countries, across much of West Africa, live in areas where conditions are suitable for zoonotic transmission of {LASV}. Four of these countries, where at-risk populations are predicted, have yet to report any cases of Lassa fever.These maps act as a spatial guide for future surveillance activities to better characterise the geographical distribution of the disease and understand the anthropological, virological and zoological interactions necessary for viral transmission. Combining this zoonotic niche map with detailed patient travel histories can aid differential diagnoses of febrile illnesses, enabling a more rapid response in providing care and reducing the risk of onward transmission.},

The implications of these fluctuations for zoonotic spillover remain poorly understood. Here, we report a global empirical analysis of data describing the linkages between habitat use, population fluctuations and zoonotic reservoir status in rodents. Our quantitative synthesis is based on data collated from papers and databases. We show that the magnitude of population fluctuations combined with species’ synanthropy and degree of human exploitation together distinguish most rodent reservoirs at a global scale, a result that was consistent across all pathogen types and pathogen transmission modes. Our spatial analyses identified hotspots of high transmission risk, including regions where reservoir species dominate the rodent community. Beyond rodents, these generalities inform our understanding of how natural and anthropogenic factors interact to increase the risk of zoonotic spillover in a rapidly changing world.},

In particular, it is not yet known how movement between patches affects local disease dynamics (e.g., whether pathogen prevalence remains steady or oscillates through time). Considering a set of small, archetypal metapopulations, we find three surprisingly simple patterns emerge in local disease dynamics following the introduction of movement between patches: (1) movement between identical patches with cyclical pathogen prevalence dampens oscillations in the destination while increasing synchrony between patches; (2) when patches differ from one another in the absence of movement, adding movement allows dynamics to propagate between patches, alternatively stabilizing or destabilizing dynamics in the destination based on the dynamics at the origin; and (3) it is easier for movement to induce cyclical dynamics than to induce a steady-state. Considering these archetypal networks (and the patterns they exemplify) as building blocks of larger, more realistically complex metapopulations provides an avenue for novel insights into the role of host movement on disease dynamics. Moreover, this work demonstrates a framework for future predictive modelling of disease spread in real populations.},

However, these individuals, new to their environment, may also be particularly susceptible to circulating infections and this may result in high morbidity and mortality, potentially jeopardizing the goals of recovery. Here, using the reintroduction of the grey wolf (Canis lupus) into Yellowstone National Park as a case study, we address the question of how parasites invade a reintroduced population and consider the impact of these invasions on population performance. We find that several viral parasites rapidly invaded the population inside the park, likely via spillover from resident canid species, and we contrast these with the slower invasion of sarcoptic mange, caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The spatio-temporal patterns of mange invasion were largely consistent with patterns of host connectivity and density, and we demonstrate that the area of highest resource quality, supporting the greatest density of wolves, is also the region that appears most susceptible to repeated disease invasion and parasite-induced declines. The success of wolf reintroduction appears not to have been jeopardized by infectious disease, but now shows signs of regulation or limitation modulated by parasites.},

	abstract = {Motivation Home range is a common measure of use of space by animals because it provides ecological information that is useful for conservation applications. In macroecological studies, values are typically aggregated to species means to examine general patterns of use of space by animals. However, this ignores the environmental context in which the home range was estimated and does not account for intraspecific variation in home range size. In addition, the focus of macroecological studies on home ranges has historically been biased towards terrestrial mammals. The use of aggregated numbers and the terrestrial focus limit our ability to examine home-range patterns across different environments, their variation in time and variation between different levels of organization. Here, we introduce {HomeRange}, a global database with 75,611 home-range values across 960 different species of mammals, including terrestrial, aquatic and aerial species. Main types of variables contained The dataset contains estimates of home ranges of mammals, species names, methodological information on data collection, method of home-range estimation, period of data collection, study coordinates and name of location, in addition to species traits derived from the studies, such as body mass, life stage, reproductive status and locomotor habit. Spatial location and grain The collected data are distributed globally. Across studies, the spatial accuracy varies, with the coarsest resolution being 1°. Time period and grain The data represent information published between 1939 and 2022. Across studies, the temporal accuracy varies; some studies report start and end dates specific to the day, whereas for other studies only the month or year is reported. Major taxa and level of measurement Mammalian species from 24 of the 27 different taxonomic orders. Home-range estimates range from individual-level values to population-level averages.

Studies of infectious disease ecology rely on robust surveillance of pathogens in reservoir hosts, often based on serology, which is the detection of specific antibodies in the blood and is used to infer infection history. However, serological data can be inaccurate for inference to infection history for a variety of reasons. Two major aspects in any serological test can substantially impact results and interpretation of antibody prevalence data: cross-reactivity and cut-off thresholds used to discriminate positive and negative reactions. Given the ubiquitous use of serology as a tool for surveillance and epidemiological modeling of wildlife diseases, it is imperative to consider the strengths and limitations of serological test methodologies and interpretation of results, particularly when using data that may affect management and policy for the prevention and control of infectious diseases in wildlife. Greater consideration of population age structure and cohort representation, serological test suitability and standardized sample collection protocols can ensure that reliable data are obtained for downstream modeling applications to characterize, and evaluate interventions for, wildlife disease systems.},

	abstract = {In ecology, the grouping of species into functional groups has played a valuable role in simplifying ecological complexity. In epidemiology, further clarifications of epidemiological functions are needed: while host roles may be defined, they are often used loosely, partly because of a lack of clarity on the relationships between a host’s function and its epidemiological role. Here we focus on the definition of bridge hosts and their epidemiological consequences. Bridge hosts provide a link through which pathogens can be transmitted from maintenance host populations or communities to receptive populations that people want to protect (i.e., target hosts). A bridge host should (1) be competent for the pathogen or able to mechanically transmit it; and (2) come into direct contact or share habitat with both maintenance and target populations. Demonstration of bridging requires an operational framework that integrates ecological and epidemiological approaches. We illustrate this framework using the example of the transmission of Avian Influenza Viruses across wild bird/poultry interfaces in Africa and discuss a range of other examples that demonstrate the usefulness of our definition for other multi-host systems. Bridge hosts can be particularly important for understanding and managing infectious disease dynamics in multi-host systems at wildlife/domestic/human interfaces, including emerging infections.},

	abstract = {African swine fever virus ({ASFV}) is spreading throughout Eurasia and there is no vaccine nor treatment available, so the control is based on the implementation of strict sanitary measures. These measures include depopulation of infected and in-contact animals and export restrictions, which can lead to important economic losses, making currently African swine fever ({ASF}) the greatest threat to the global swine industry. {ASF} has been endemic on the island of Sardinia since 1978, the longest persistence of anywhere in Eurasia. In Sardinia, eradication programs have failed, in large part due to the lack of farm professionalism, the high density of wild boar and the presence of non-registered domestic pigs (free-ranging pigs). In order to clarify how the virus is transmitted from domestic to wild swine, we examined the interaction between free-ranging pigs and wild boar in an {ASF}-endemic area of Sardinia. To this end, a field study was carried out on direct and indirect interactions, using monitoring by camera trapping in different areas and risk points. Critical time windows ({CTWs}) for the virus to survive in the environment (long window) and remain infectious (short window) were estimated, and based on these, the number of indirect interactions were determined. Free-ranging pigs indirectly interacted often with wild boar (long window = 6.47 interactions/day, short window = 1.31 interactions/day) and these interactions (long window) were mainly at water sources. They also directly interacted 0.37 times per day, especially between 14:00 and 21:00 h, which is much higher than for other interspecific interactions observed in Mediterranean scenarios. The highly frequent interactions at this interspecific interface may help explain the more than four-decade-long endemicity of {ASF} on the island. Supporting that free-ranging pigs can act as a bridge to transmit {ASFV} between wild boar and registered domestic pigs. This study contributes broadly to improving the knowledge on the estimation of frequencies of direct and indirect interactions between wild and free-ranging domestic swine. As well as supporting the importance of the analysis of interspecific interactions in shared infectious diseases, especially for guiding disease management. Finally, this work illustrates the power of the camera-trapping method for analyzing interspecific interfaces.},

We use as a case study the 1988 epidemic of phocine distemper virus in the North Sea population of harbour seals, Phoca vitulina. 2. We summarize the available data on this epidemic and use it to parameterize a stochastic compartmental model for an infection spreading through a spatial array of patches coupled by nearest-neighbour mixing, with replacement of susceptibles occurring as a discrete annual event. 3. A combination of analytical and simulation techniques is used to show that the high levels of transmission between different seal subpopulations, combined with the small annual birth cohort, act to make persistence of infection impossible in this harbour seal population at realistic population levels. The well known mechanisms by which metapopulation structures may act to promote persistence can be seen to have an effect only at weaker levels of spatial coupling, and higher levels of host recruitment, than those empirically observed.},

	abstract = {Background The classical method for detection of Lassa virus-specific antibodies is the immunofluorescence assay ({IFA}) using virus-infected cells as antigen. However, {IFA} requires laboratories of biosafety level 4 for assay production and an experienced investigator to interpret the fluorescence signals. Therefore, we aimed to establish and evaluate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ({ELISA}) using recombinant Lassa virus nucleoprotein ({NP}) as antigen. Methodology/Principal findings The {IgM} {ELISA} is based on capturing {IgM} antibodies using anti-{IgM}, and the {IgG} {ELISA} is based on capturing {IgG} antibody–antigen complexes using rheumatoid factor or Fc gamma receptor {CD}32a. Analytical and clinical evaluation was performed with 880 sera from Lassa fever endemic (Nigeria) and non-endemic (Ghana and Germany) areas. Using the {IFA} as reference method, we observed 91.5–94.3\% analytical accuracy of the {ELISAs} in detecting Lassa virus-specific antibodies. Evaluation of the {ELISAs} for diagnosis of Lassa fever on admission to hospital in an endemic area revealed a clinical sensitivity for the stand-alone {IgM} {ELISA} of 31\% (95\% {CI} 25–37) and for combined {IgM}/{IgG} detection of 26\% (95\% {CI} 21–32) compared to {RT}-{PCR}. The specificity of {IgM} and {IgG} {ELISA} was estimated at 96\% (95\% {CI} 93–98) and 100\% (95\% {CI} 99–100), respectively, in non-Lassa fever patients from non-endemic areas. In patients who seroconverted during follow-up, Lassa virus-specific {IgM} and {IgG} developed simultaneously rather than sequentially. Consistent with this finding, isolated {IgM} reactivity, i.e. {IgM} in the absence of {IgG}, had no diagnostic value. Conclusions/Significance The {ELISAs} are not equivalent to {RT}-{PCR} for early diagnosis of Lassa fever; however, they are of value in diagnosing patients at later stage. The {IgG} {ELISA} may be useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials due its high specificity, and the higher throughput rate and easier operation compared to {IFA}.},

The assay was used for laboratory-bred Mastomys rodents, as well as for animals caught in the wild in various regions of West Africa. The {ELISA} reached an accuracy of 97.1\% in samples of known exposure, and a comparison to an immunofluorescence assay ({IFA}) revealed a very strong agreement between the {ELISA} and {IFA} results (Cohen's kappa of 0.81). The agreement is valid in Nigeria, and in Guinea and Sierra Leone where the lineages {II} and {IV} are circulating, respectively. Altogether, these results indicate that this capture {ELISA} is suitable for {LASV} {IgG} serostatus determination in Mastomys rodents as an alternative to {IFA}. This assay will be a strong, accurate, and semi-quantitative alternative for rodent seroprevalence studies that does not depend on biosafety level 4 infrastructures, providing great benefits for ecology and epidemiology studies of Lassa fever, a disease listed on the Research and Development Blueprint of the {WHO}.},

When effect sizes are not independent, conclusions based on these conventional procedures can be misleading or even wrong.

These ad-hoc approaches, however, may lead to missed opportunities to utilize all available data to address the relevant research questions. Both multivariate meta-analysis and three-level meta-analysis have been proposed to handle non-independent effect sizes. This paper gives a brief introduction to these new techniques for applied researchers. The first objective is to highlight the benefits of using these methods to address non-independent effect sizes. The second objective is to illustrate how to apply these techniques with real data in R and Mplus. Researchers may modify the sample R and Mplus code to fit their data.},

	abstract = {Background Lassa virus ({LASV}), the cause of the acute viral hemorrhagic illness Lassa fever ({LF}), is endemic in West Africa. Infections in humans occur mainly after exposure to infected excrement or urine of the rodent-host, Mastomys natalensis. The prevalence of exposure to {LASV} in Sierra Leone is crudely estimated and largely unknown. This cross-sectional study aimed to establish a baseline point seroprevalence of {IgG} antibodies to {LASV} in three administrative districts of Sierra Leone and identify potential risk factors for seropositivity and {LASV} exposure. Methodology and principal findings Between 2015 and 2018, over 10,642 participants from Kenema, Tonkolili, and Port Loko Districts were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Previous {LASV} and {LF} epidemiological studies support classification of these districts as “endemic,” “emerging,” and “non-endemic”, respectively. Dried blood spot samples were tested for {LASV} antibodies by {ELISA} to determine the seropositivity of participants, indicating previous exposure to {LASV}. Surveys were administered to each participant to assess demographic and environmental factors associated with a higher risk of exposure to {LASV}. Overall seroprevalence for antibodies to {LASV} was 16.0\%. In Kenema, Port Loko, and Tonkolili Districts, seroprevalences were 20.1\%, 14.1\%, and 10.6\%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, individuals were more likely to be {LASV} seropositive if they were living in Kenema District, regardless of sex, age, or occupation. Environmental factors contributed to an increased risk of {LASV} exposure, including poor housing construction and proximity to bushland, forested areas, and refuse. Conclusions and significance In this study we determine a baseline {LASV} seroprevalence in three districts which will inform future epidemiological, ecological, and clinical studies on {LF} and the {LASV} in Sierra Leone. The heterogeneity of the distribution of {LASV} and {LF} over both space, and time, can make the design of efficacy trials and intervention programs difficult. Having more studies on the prevalence of {LASV} and identifying potential hyper-endemic areas will greatly increase the awareness of {LF} and improve targeted control programs related to {LASV}.},

Before 2003, two human {CoVs} ({HCoVs}) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome ({MERS}) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an {HCoV} infection could be. The emergence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted {CoVs} into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister {SARS}-{CoV}. {HCoV} infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of {HCoVs} would serve us well. Most {HCoVs} originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some {HCoVs} are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating {CoV}-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on {CoV} pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven {HCoVs}, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different {HCoVs} from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current {CoV} disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) epidemic is discussed in this context. In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Based on findings demonstrating the simian ancestry of {HIV}, {AIDS} has been reported to be a zoonosis. However, this theory has never been proved and must seriously be questioned. Several arguments show that {HIV}-{AIDS} is not a zoonosis. (i) If {AIDS} were a zoonosis, there must be evidence of {AIDS} being directly acquired from an animal species, as is rabies, a disease that is directly acquired from animals. (ii) Despite long-term and frequent human exposure to {SIV}-infected monkeys in Africa, only 11 cross-species transmission events are known, and only four of these have resulted in significant human-to-human transmission, generating {HIV}-1 groups M and O and {HIV}-2 groups A and B. The closest relatives of {SIVcpz} ({HIV}-1 group N) and of {SIVsm} ({HIV}-2 groups C–H) are extremely rare, with only six {HIV}-1 group N-infected patients and only single individuals known to be infected by {HIV}-2 groups C–H. {SIV}, while capable of cross-species transmission, is thus poorly adapted for disease and epidemic spread. If {AIDS} were a zoonosis that is capable of significant human-to-human spread, there would be a plethora of founder subtypes and groups. (iii) Human exposure to {SIV} is thousands of years old, but {AIDS} emerged only in the 20th century. If {AIDS} were a zoonosis that spread into the human population, it would have spread to the West during slave trade. (iv) Experimental transmission of {SIVs} to different species of monkeys is often well controlled by the new host, showing that the virus and not the disease is transmitted. Therefore, we conclude that cross-species transmission of {SIV} does not in itself constitute the basis for a zoonosis. Transmission per se is not the major requirement for the generation of the {AIDS} epidemic. All {HIVs} do derive from simian species, but {AIDS} does not qualify as a zoonosis and this explanation cannot in itself account for the origin of {AIDS} epidemic. It is important to distinguish {AIDS} from true zoonoses (e.g. rabies) because research is needed to understand the processes by which animal viruses cause sustained human-to-human transmission, epidemics and even pandemics. Much is known about emerging viruses, but almost nothing is known about emerging viral diseases.},

	abstract = {The {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pandemic has led to increased concern over transmission of pathogens from humans to animals, and its potential to threaten conservation and public health. To assess this threat, we reviewed published evidence of human-to-wildlife transmission events, with a focus on how such events could threaten animal and human health. We identified 97 verified examples, involving a wide range of pathogens; however, reported hosts were mostly non-human primates or large, long-lived captive animals. Relatively few documented examples resulted in morbidity and mortality, and very few led to maintenance of a human pathogen in a new reservoir or subsequent “secondary spillover” back into humans. We discuss limitations in the literature surrounding these phenomena, including strong evidence of sampling bias towards non-human primates and human-proximate mammals and the possibility of systematic bias against reporting human parasites in wildlife, both of which limit our ability to assess the risk of human-to-wildlife pathogen transmission. We outline how researchers can collect experimental and observational evidence that will expand our capacity for risk assessment for human-to-wildlife pathogen transmission.},

	abstract = {The largest monkeypox virus ({MPXV}) outbreak described so far in non-endemic countries was identified in May 2022 (refs. 1–6). In this study, shotgun metagenomics allowed the rapid reconstruction and phylogenomic characterization of the first {MPXV} outbreak genome sequences, showing that this {MPXV} belongs to clade 3 and that the outbreak most likely has a single origin. Although 2022 {MPXV} (lineage B.1) clustered with 2018–2019 cases linked to an endemic country, it segregates in a divergent phylogenetic branch, likely reflecting continuous accelerated evolution. An in-depth mutational analysis suggests the action of host {APOBEC}3 in viral evolution as well as signs of potential {MPXV} human adaptation in ongoing microevolution. Our findings also indicate that genome sequencing may provide resolution to track the spread and transmission of this presumably slow-evolving double-stranded {DNA} virus.},

The epidemiology of the virus remains poorly understood, and while case-based and seroepidemiological studies have been employed extensively throughout the epidemic, viral sequence data have not been utilised to their full potential. Here, we use existing {MERS}-{CoV} sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in two of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term {MERS}-{CoV} evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host. By analysing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoonotic introduction times, we show that human outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula are driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from camels. Without heretofore unseen evolution of host tropism, {MERS}-{CoV} is unlikely to become endemic in humans.},

Since human environmental changes are largely responsible for their emergence, the threats wildlife {EIDs} pose to biodiversity and human health represent yet another consequence of anthropogenic influence on ecosystems.

	shorttitle = {Potential Influence of Climate Change on Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases},
	abstract = {Background

Because of complex interactions of climate variables at the levels of the pathogen, vector, and host, the potential influence of climate change on vector-borne and zoonotic diseases ({VBZDs}) is poorly understood and difficult to predict. Climate effects on the nonvector-borne zoonotic diseases are especially obscure and have received scant treatment.

Objective

We described known and potential effects of climate change on {VBZDs} and proposed specific studies to increase our understanding of these effects. The nonvector-borne zoonotic diseases have received scant treatment and are emphasized in this paper.

Data sources and synthesis

We used a review of the existing literature and extrapolations from observations of short-term climate variation to suggest potential impacts of climate change on {VBZDs}. Using public health priorities on climate change, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we developed six specific goals for increasing understanding of the interaction between climate and {VBZDs} and for improving capacity for predicting climate change effects on incidence and distribution of {VBZDs}.

Conclusions

Climate change may affect the incidence of {VBZDs} through its effect on four principal characteristics of host and vector populations that relate to pathogen transmission to humans: geographic distribution, population density, prevalence of infection by zoonotic pathogens, and the pathogen load in individual hosts and vectors. These mechanisms may interact with each other and with other factors such as anthropogenic disturbance to produce varying effects on pathogen transmission within host and vector populations and to humans. Because climate change effects on most {VBZDs} act through wildlife hosts and vectors, understanding these effects will require multidisciplinary teams to conduct and interpret ecosystem-based studies of {VBZD} pathogens in host and vector populations and to identify the hosts, vectors, and pathogens with the greatest potential to affect human populations under climate change scenarios.},

In this paper, we examine mechanisms by which climate change can affect various ecological factors that are likely to drive an increase in the overall incidence as well as the frequency of outbreaks of leptospirosis. We will discuss the geographical areas that are most likely to be at risk of an increase in leptospirosis disease burden owing to the coexistence of climate change hazard risk, environmental drivers of leptospirosis outbreaks, local socioeconomic circumstances, and social and demographic trends. To reduce this disease burden, enhanced surveillance and further research is required to understand the environmental drivers of infection, to build capacity in emergency response and to promote community adaptation to a changing climate.},

In Argentina, some regions have climatic and geographical characteristics that favor the habitat of bacteria of the Leptospira genus, whose survival strongly depends on climatic factors, enhanced by climate change, which increase the problems associated with people’s health. In order to have a method to predict leptospirosis cases, in this paper, five time series forecasting methods are compared: two parametric (autoregressive integrated moving average and an alternative one that allows covariates, {ARIMA} and {ARIMAX}, respectively), two nonparametric (Nadaraya-Watson Kernel estimator, one and two kernels versions, {NW}-1 K and {NW}-2 K), and one semiparametric (semi-functional partial linear regression, {SFPLR}) method. For this, the number of cases of leptospirosis registered from 2009 to 2020 in three important cities of northeastern Argentina is used, as well as hydroclimatic covariates related to the presence of cases. According to the obtained results, there is no method that improves considerably the rest and can be recommended as a unique tool for leptospirosis prediction. However, in general, the {NW}-2 K method gets a better performance. This work, in addition to using a long-term high-quality time series, enriches the area of applications of statistical models to epidemiological leptospirosis data by the incorporation of hydroclimatic variables, and it is recommended directing further efforts in this line of research, under the context of current climate change.},

	abstract = {Background
In Europe, the frequency, intensity, and geographic range of West Nile virus ({WNV})-outbreaks have increased over the past decade, with a 7.2-fold increase in 2018 compared to 2017, and a markedly expanded geographic area compared to 2010. The reasons for this increase and range expansion remain largely unknown due to the complexity of the transmission pathways and underlying disease drivers. In a first, we use advanced artificial intelligence to disentangle the contribution of eco-climatic drivers to {WNV}-outbreaks across Europe using decade-long (2010-2019) data at high spatial resolution.
Methods
We use a high-performance machine learning classifier, {XGBoost} ({eXtreme} gradient boosting) combined with state-of-the-art {XAI} ({eXplainable} artificial intelligence) methodology to describe the predictive ability and contribution of different drivers of the emergence and transmission of {WNV}-outbreaks in Europe, respectively.
Findings
Our model, trained on 2010-2017 data achieved an {AUC} (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) score of 0.97 and 0.93 when tested with 2018 and 2019 data, respectively, showing a high discriminatory power to classify a {WNV}-endemic area. Overall, positive summer/spring temperatures anomalies, lower water availability index ({NDWI}), and drier winter conditions were found to be the main determinants of {WNV}-outbreaks across Europe. The climate trends of the preceding year in combination with eco-climatic predictors of the first half of the year provided a robust predictive ability of the entire transmission season ahead of time. For the extraordinary 2018 outbreak year, relatively higher spring temperatures and the abundance of Culex mosquitoes were the strongest predictors, in addition to past climatic trends.
Interpretation
Our {AI}-based framework can be deployed to trigger rapid and timely alerts for active surveillance and vector control measures in order to intercept an imminent {WNV}-outbreak in Europe.

	abstract = {Climate has strong impacts on the spatial ranges of vector-borne infectious diseases as well as the timing and intensity of disease outbreaks; these and shifting challenges to human health driven by future climate change are critical concerns. Many diseases of tropical origin, including West Nile virus ({WNV}), are sensitive to climate and likely to change their distributions in the coming decades. The 1999 outbreak of {WNV} in North America is an example of rapid viral adaptation to a new geographic area while recent outbreaks in Europe demonstrate the capacity of multiple viral strains to expand rapidly. {WNV} is one of the most widely distributed arboviruses and has displayed high rates of mutability, adaptability, and virulence. Northward expansion of {WNV} is happening in Europe and North America and may make {WNV} an increasingly worrying health risk at higher latitudes. Circumpolar northward expansion of {WNV}’s enzootic range appears unlikely over the coming century—at least for sustained enzootic transmission—but isolated and ephemeral transmission events might occur if the virus were to be introduced by migrating birds during warm months. Human populations in this area are at greater risk for health impacts from {WNV} transmission due to limited healthcare in rural areas, higher underlying morbidity in indigenous populations, and prolonged human-environment interactions (in populations engaging in traditional lifestyles). This review presents a multidisciplinary synthesis on {WNV} and climate change, potential for {WNV} expansion, and the vulnerability of the circumpolar north. {WIREs} Clim Change 2016, 7:283–300. doi: 10.1002/wcc.382 This article is categorized under: Assessing Impacts of Climate Change {\textgreater} Evaluating Future Impacts of Climate Change},

We conducted a systematic review 305 scientific articles investigating how specific types of anthropogenic land use change influence infectious disease dynamics. We summarized findings, highlighted common themes, and drew attention to neglected areas of research. There was an increase in publications on this topic over the last 30 years spanning diseases of humans, livestock, and wildlife, including a large number of zoonotic pathogens. Most papers (66.9\%) were observational, 30.8\% were review or concept papers, and few studies (2.3\%) were experimental in nature, with most studies focusing on vector-borne and/or multi-host pathogens. Common land use change types related to disease transmission were deforestation/forest fragmentation/habitat fragmentation, agricultural development/irrigation, and urbanization/suburbanization. In response to anthropogenic change, more than half of the studies (56.9\%) documented increased pathogen transmission, 10.4\% of studies observed decreased pathogen transmission, 30.4\% had variable and complex pathogen responses, and 2.4\% showed no detectable changes. Commonly reported mechanisms by which land use change altered infectious disease transmission included alteration of the vector, host, and pathogen niche, changes in host and vector community composition, changes in behavior or movement of vectors and/or hosts, altered spatial distribution of hosts and/or vectors, and socioeconomic factors, and environmental contamination. We discussed observed patterns in the literature and make suggestions for future research directions, emphasizing the importance of ecological and evolutionary theory to understand pathogen responses in changing landscapes.},

	abstract = {Viruses that originate in bats may be the most notorious emerging zoonoses that spill over from wildlife into domestic animals and humans. Understanding how these infections filter through ecological systems to cause disease in humans is of profound importance to public health. Transmission of viruses from bats to humans requires a hierarchy of enabling conditions that connect the distribution of reservoir hosts, viral infection within these hosts, and exposure and susceptibility of recipient hosts. For many emerging bat viruses, spillover also requires viral shedding from bats, and survival of the virus in the environment. Focusing on Hendra virus, but also addressing Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus and coronaviruses, we delineate this cross-species spillover dynamic from the within-host processes that drive virus excretion to land-use changes that increase interaction among species. We describe how land-use changes may affect co-occurrence and contact between bats and recipient hosts. Two hypotheses may explain temporal and spatial pulses of virus shedding in bat populations: episodic shedding from persistently infected bats or transient epidemics that occur as virus is transmitted among bat populations. Management of livestock also may affect the probability of exposure and disease. Interventions to decrease the probability of virus spillover can be implemented at multiple levels from targeting the reservoir host to managing recipient host exposure and susceptibility.},

The natural reservoir for Nipah virus and related members of the genus Henipavirus are fruit bats of the genus Pteropus. Nipah virus emerged in Malaysia in 1998 as a porcine neurologic and respiratory disease that spread to humans who had contact with live, infected pigs. Research reviewed in this paper suggests that anthropogenic factors, including agricultural expansion and intensification, were the underlying causes of its emergence. Nipah virus has caused five subsequent outbreaks between 2001 and 2005 in Bangladesh.

	abstract = {The dilution and amplification effects are important concepts in the field of zoonotic diseases. While the dilution effect predicts that pathogen prevalence is negatively correlated with increased species diversity, the opposite trend is observed when the amplification effect occurs. Understanding how interspecific interactions such as predation and competition within a community influence disease transmission is highly relevant. We explore the conditions under which the dilution and amplification effects arise, using compartmental models that integrate ecological and epidemiological interactions. We formulate an intraguild predation model where each species is divided into two compartments: susceptible and infected individuals. We obtained that increasing predation increases the disease transmission potential of the predator and the density of infected individuals, but decreases the disease transmission potential of the prey, as well as their density. Also, we found that interspecific competition always helps to decrease the number of infected individuals in the population of the two species. Therefore, dilution and amplification effects can be observed simultaneously but depending on different types of cological interactions.},

Here, pathogen characteristics, host range and risk factors determining disease emergence were analysed by constructing a database of disease–causing pathogens of humans and domestic mammals. The database consisted of 1415 pathogens causing disease in humans, 616 in livestock and 374 in domestic carnivores. Multihost pathogens were very prevalent among human pathogens (61.6\%) and even more so among domestic mammal pathogens (livestock 77.3\%, carnivores 90.0\%). Pathogens able to infect human, domestic and wildlife hosts contained a similar proportion of disease–causing pathogens for all three host groups. One hundred and ninety–six pathogens were associated with emerging diseases, 175 in humans, 29 in livestock and 12 in domestic carnivores. Across all these groups, helminths and fungi were relatively unlikely to emerge whereas viruses, particularly {RNA} viruses, were highly likely to emerge. The ability of a pathogen to infect multiple hosts, particularly hosts in other taxonomic orders or wildlife, were also risk factors for emergence in human and livestock pathogens. There is clearly a need to understand the dynamics of infectious diseases in complex multihost communities in order to mitigate disease threats to public health, livestock economies and wildlife.},

Population biology has yet to explain why perceived evolutionary advantages of pathogen specialization are, in practice, outweighed by those of generalization. Factors that predispose pathogens to generalism include high levels of genetic diversity and abundant opportunities for cross-species transmission, and the taxonomic distributions of generalists and specialists appear to reflect these factors. Generalism also has consequences for the evolution of virulence and for pathogen epidemiology, making both much less predictable. The evolutionary advantages and disadvantages of generalism are so finely balanced that even closely related pathogens can have very different host range sizes.},

To directly test whether such “special reservoirs” of zoonoses exist, we used literature searches to construct the largest existing dataset of virus–reservoir relationships, consisting of the avian and mammalian reservoir hosts of 415 {RNA} and {DNA} viruses along with their histories of human infection. Reservoir host effects on the propensity of viruses to have been reported as infecting humans were rare and when present were restricted to one or two viral families. The data instead support a largely host-neutral explanation for the distribution of human-infecting viruses across the animal orders studied. After controlling for higher baseline viral richness in mammals versus birds, the observed number of zoonoses per animal order increased as a function of their species richness. Animal orders of established importance as zoonotic reservoirs including bats and rodents were unexceptional, maintaining numbers of zoonoses that closely matched expectations for mammalian groups of their size. Our findings show that variation in the frequency of zoonoses among animal orders can be explained without invoking special ecological or immunological relationships between hosts and viruses, pointing to a need to reconsider current approaches aimed at finding and predicting novel zoonoses.},

Strategies are needed to identify and characterize animal viruses that pose the greatest risk of spillover and spread in humans and inform public health interventions. Using expert opinion and scientific evidence, we identified host, viral, and environmental risk factors contributing to zoonotic virus spillover and spread in humans. We then developed a risk ranking framework and interactive web tool, {SpillOver}, that estimates a risk score for wildlife-origin viruses, creating a comparative risk assessment of viruses with uncharacterized zoonotic spillover potential alongside those already known to be zoonotic. Using data from testing 509,721 samples from 74,635 animals as part of a virus discovery project and public records of virus detections around the world, we ranked the spillover potential of 887 wildlife viruses. Validating the risk assessment, the top 12 were known zoonotic viruses, including {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Several newly detected wildlife viruses ranked higher than known zoonotic viruses. Using a scientifically informed process, we capitalized on the recent wealth of virus discovery data to systematically identify and prioritize targets for investigation. The publicly accessible {SpillOver} platform can be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks. {SpillOver} is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health.},

Although we cannot predict the level of health threat that these new viruses will present, we conclude that novel virus species must be anticipated in public health planning.

Modern developments such as industrial food production, vaccine production and blood transfusion may be making us more vulnerable than ever to new pathogens. The authors argue that people with high exposure to wild animals, such as hunters, zoo workers and wildlife veterinarians, should be regularly screened for emergent pathogens.This would provide early warning of newly introduced disease, and supply a repository of tissue samples that would assist in reconstructing the origin of later outbreaks.},

We then compare congruence of hotspots in two animal groups (mammals and birds) to assess the generality of these patterns. We defined hotspots as the richest 2.5\% of cells in a global equal-area grid comparable to 1° latitude × 1° longitude. Hotspots of species richness, “endemism,” and extinction threat were noncongruent. Only 1\% of cells and 16\% of species were common to the three types of mammalian hotspots. Congruence increased with increases in both the geographic scope of the analysis and the percentage of cells defined as being hotspots. The within-mammal hotspot noncongruence was similar to the pattern recently found for birds. Thus, assigning global conservation priorities based on hotspots is at best a limited strategy.},

Projections for the next half century expect a highly divergent world, with stagnation or potential decline in parts of the developed world and continued rapid growth in the least developed regions. Other demographic processes are also undergoing extraordinary change: women's fertility has dropped rapidly and life expectancy has risen to new highs. Past trends in fertility and mortality have led to very young populations in high fertility countries in the developing world and to increasingly older populations in the developed world. Contemporary societies are now at very different stages of their demographic transitions. This paper summarizes key trends in population size, fertility and mortality, and age structures during these transitions.

The common notion of desertification is of an advancing “desert,” a generally irreversible anthropogenic process. This process has been linked to increased surface albedo, increased dust generation, and reduced productivity of the land. This study demonstrates that there has been no progressive change of either the Saharan boundary or vegetation cover in the Sahel during the last 16 years, nor has there been a systematic reduction of “productivity” as assessed by the water-use efficiency of the vegetation cover. While it also showed little change in surface albedo during the years analyzed, this study suggests that a change in albedo of up to 0.10\% since the 1950s is conceivable.},

	abstract = {This brief presents a factual and retrospective analysis of the relationships between urbanisation and demography in North Africa and West Africa. It shows that the process of demographic transition is now fully underway in this region. North of the Sahara the new demographic equilibrium features a birth rate higher than expected, according to theoretical model predictions, resulting in continuous population growth. Over 70\% of the population now lives in cities, a number that is expected to continue to rise in the coming decades. South of the Sahara all countries have seen death rates plummet, followed by a decrease in birth rates. The gap between the change in the two variables has contributed to spectacular natural growth in the space of a few decades. This growth is occurring in parallel with a redistribution of populations to urban areas, which are now home to close to one of every two inhabitants. West African urbanisation is likely to accelerate the social, economic and political changes that favour the demographic transition. One of the main challenges facing the region is the question of how to reduce the regional variations seen in fertility rates between the continent’s urban and rural areas.},

	abstract = {This contribution critically explores changing relationships between diamond mining and patterns of urbanisation in Sierra Leone. In providing an historical overview of mining expansion and contraction, the paper highlights the significant impacts that mining has had on the rural–urban continuum, and how this has shaped political, economic and social change in diamondiferous regions. Focusing on Kono District, the effects of diamond mining on populations are evaluated before, during and after the civil war, demonstrating how diamonds have had diverse and varying impacts on both population mobility and urban agglomeration at different points in time. While much attention has focused on the social consequences of wartime displacement from diamondiferous areas to the capital city, Freetown, recent research suggests that the post-war return of young people to diamond mining regions has had unexpected consequences. Most significantly, a decline in artisanal mining activities and the rise of large-scale industrial mining has reawakened the interest of young ex-miners in farming, especially those who enjoy hereditary land rights. While one consequence of the war may be that the population is now more urban and more mobile, the paper concludes that the return of young people to their villages of origin, and rapprochement with local chiefs, may be helping to drive a resurgence of community-based cooperation in Kono District, a development which could provide a more durable basis for sustainable and democratic development in the years to come.},

	shorttitle = {Regulating agricultural intensification},
	abstract = {Motivation Imports of pesticides, especially herbicides, almost tripled in value across West Africa between 2005 and 2015. This remarkable increase has been driven by falling prices of generic pesticides, rising costs of farm labour for weeding, rising demand for farm produce, and the recent invasion of an exotic pest from the Americas, the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda). Despite rapid growth in pesticide markets, policy enforcement has not kept pace. As a result, fraudulent pesticides—often underdosed—now account for roughly one-third of pesticides sold in the region. Fraud on this scale compromises agricultural growth, human health and environmental safety. Purpose This article aims to assess the consequences of rapidly growing pesticide markets for farmers, traders and policy-makers. Approach and methods Seven national studies of pesticide markets and policy implementation—in Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal—provide empirical evidence for this article. Following reviews of existing documents and statistics, each study involved structured interviews with regulators, policy-makers, traders and farmers. Multiple feedback sessions with key regional stakeholder groups vetted core findings. Findings The investigations reveal rapid changes in the structure and performance of pesticide supply chains, including a major proliferation of generic brands and unlicensed traders, high levels of fraud, and wide variability in pesticide quality. In response, four broad regulatory models are emerging across Africa: (1) purely national testing, registration and monitoring; (2) harmonized regional protocols for testing, with national registration and monitoring; (3) regional testing and registration with national monitoring; and (4) regional testing, registration and monitoring. Purely national models are most common, but they prove costly for Africa’s many small countries. In all models, weaknesses in post-registration monitoring and enforcement mean that risks to human health and the environment go largely unmonitored. Policy implications The findings suggest several practical avenues for improving agricultural input quality and environmental safety. In the short term, stakeholder coalitions of responsible traders, farmer groups and regulators can campaign for authentic products, researchers need to step up environmental monitoring of pesticide use and impacts, and pest control specialists appear poised to continue encouraging integrated pest management to economize on use of chemicals. In the medium term, moves to regional harmonization and co-operation reduce opportunities for smuggling and enable regional pooling of scarce technical personnel, while policy-makers seek feasible ways of expanding resources for registration and monitoring systems commensurate with the rapid increases in pesticide use. In political economy terms, current pest invasions open a window of opportunity potentially enabling necessary structural reform of pesticide policies and regulatory systems.},

Pigs were identified as a susceptible host for Reston virus with subsequent transmission to humans reported in the Philippines. To date, there is no evidence of natural Ebola virus ({EBOV}) infection in pigs, although pigs were shown to be susceptible to {EBOV} infection under experimental settings. To investigate the potential role of pigs in the ecology of {EBOV}, we analyzed 400 porcine serum samples from Sierra Leone for the presence of ebolavirus-specific antibodies. Three samples reacted with ebolavirus nucleoproteins but had no neutralizing antibodies. Our results (1) suggest the circulation of ebolaviruses in swine in Sierra Leone that are antigenically related but not identical to {EBOV} and (2) could represent undiscovered ebolaviruses with unknown pathogenic and/or zoonotic potential.},

	abstract = {Background
Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever endemic in Nigeria. Improved surveillance and testing capacity have revealed in an increased number of reported cases and apparent geographic spread of Lassa fever in Nigeria. We described the recent four-year trend of Lassa fever in Nigeria to improve understanding of its epidemiology and inform the design of appropriate interventions.

Methods
We analysed the national surveillance data on Lassa fever maintained by the Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control ({NCDC}) and described trends, sociodemographic, geographic distribution, and clinical outcomes. We compared cases, positivity, and clinical outcomes in the period January 2018 to December 2021.

Results
We found Lassa fever to be reported throughout the year with more than half the cases reported within the first quarter of the year, a recent increase in numbers and geographic spread of the virus, and male and adult ({\textgreater}18 years) preponderance. Case fatality rates were worse in males, the under-five and elderly, during off-peak periods, and among low reporting states.

Conclusion
Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria with a recent increase in numbers and geographical distribution. Sustaining improved surveillance, enhanced laboratory diagnosis and improved case management capacity during off-peak periods should remain a priority. Attention should be paid to the very young and elderly during outbreaks. Further research efforts should identify and address specific factors that determine poor clinical outcomes.},

Here, we provide an overview of changes in our understanding of the systematics of living rodents, including species recognition and delimitation, phylogenetics, and classification, with emphasis on the last three decades. Roughly, this corresponds to the {DNA} sequencing era of rodent systematics, but the field is undergoing a transition into the genomic era. At least 248 species were newly described in the period 2000–2017, including novelties such as the first living member of Diatomyidae and a murid species without molars (Paucidentomys vermidax), thus highlighting the fact that our understanding of rodent diversity is going through an age of discovery. Mito-nuclear discordance (including that resulting from mitochondrial introgression) has been detected in some of the few taxonomic studies that have assessed variation of two or more unlinked loci. As studies incorporate more loci, incomplete lineage sorting and introgression are likely to gain recognition as widespread phenomena in the near future. Molecular phylogenetics has had a major impact in rodent phylogeny and allowed the identification of three major rodent clades, here recognized as suborders: 1) the Hystricomorpha (sometimes referred as the Ctenohystrica) and including two infraorders, Hystricognathi and Ctenodactylomorphi; 2) the Sciuromorpha; and 3) the Supramyomorpha, a new suborder that comprises the infraorders Castorimorphi, Anomalurimorphi, and Myomorphi. In spite of the greater understanding and ensuing stability of rodent phylogeny gained during the last three decades, several major areas of the rodent tree remain unresolved or poorly supported. We expect that the analysis of genomic-scale data will help resolve those areas of the radiation of Rodentia that still remain poorly understood.},

These responses are moulded by selection to be appropriate to the actual antigenic environment in which the animals live, but without imposing an excessive energetic demand which compromises other component of fitness. But, exactly what these responses are, and how they compare with those of laboratory animals, has been little studied. Here, we review the very small number of published studies of immune responses of wild rodents, finding general agreement that their humoral (antibody) responses are highly elevated when compared with those of laboratory animals, and that wild rodents’ cellular immune system reveals extensive antigenic exposure. In contrast, proliferative and cytokine responses of ex vivo-stimulated immune cells of wild rodents are typically depressed compared with those of laboratory animals. Collectively, these responses are appropriate to wild animals’ lives, because the elevated responses reflect the cumulative exposure to infection, while the depressed proliferative and cytokine responses are indicative of effective immune homeostasis that minimizes immunopathology. A more comprehensive understanding of the immune ecology of wild animals requires (i) understanding the antigenic load to which wild animals are exposed, and identification of any key antigens that mould the immune repertoire, (ii) identifying immunoregulatory processes of wild animals and the events that induce them, and (iii) understanding the actual resource state of wild animals, and the immunological consequences that flow from this. Together, by extending studies of wild rodents, particularly addressing these questions (while drawing on our immunological understanding of laboratory animals), we will be better able to understand how rodents’ immune responses contribute to their fitness in the wild.},

	abstract = {Immune activity is variable within and among vertebrates despite the potentially large fitness costs of pathogens to their
hosts. From the perspective of life history theory, immunological variability may be the consequence of counterbalancing
investments in immune defense against other expensive physiological processes, namely, reproduction. In the present study, we
tested the hypothesis that immune defense among captive-bred, disease-free Peromyscus mice would be influenced by
their reproductive life history strategies. Specifically, we expected that small species that reproduce prolifically and mature
rapidly (i.e., fast pace of life) would favor inexpensive, nonspecific immune defenses to promote reproductive proclivity.
Alternatively, we expected that large species that mature slowly and invest modestly in reproduction over multiple events (i.e.,
slow pace of life) would favor developmentally expensive, specific immune defenses and avoid cheap, nonspecific ones because such
defenses are predisposed to self-damage. We found that species exhibited either strong ability to kill (gram-negative) bacteria, a
developmentally inexpensive defense, or strong ability to produce antibodies against a novel protein, a developmentally expensive
defense, but not both. Cell-mediated inflammation also varied significantly among species, but in a unique fashion relative to
bacteria killing or antibody production; wound healing was comparatively similar among species. These results indicate that
Peromyscus species use immune strategies that are constrained to a dominant axis, but this axis is not
determined solely by reproductive pace of life. Further comparisons, ideally with broader phylogenetic coverage, could identify
what ecological and evolutionary forces produce the pattern we detected. Importantly, our study indicates that species may not be
differentially immunocompetent; rather, they use unique defense strategies to prevent infection.},

We investigated the relationship between human alteration of the environment and the occurrence of generalist and synanthropic rodent species in relation to the diversity and prevalence of rodent-borne pathogens in Southeast Asia, a hotspot of threatened and endangered species, and a foci of emerging infectious diseases. We used data from an extensive pathogen survey of rodents from seven sites in mainland Southeast Asia in conjunction with past and present land cover analyses. At low spatial resolutions, we found that rodent-borne pathogen richness is negatively associated with increasing urbanization, characterized by increased habitat fragmentation, agriculture cover and deforestation. However, at a finer spatial resolution, we found that some major pathogens are favored by environmental characteristics associated with human alteration including irrigation, habitat fragmentation, and increased agricultural land cover. In addition, synanthropic rodents, many of which are important pathogen reservoirs, were associated with fragmented and human-dominated landscapes, which may ultimately enhance the opportunities for zoonotic transmission and human infection by some pathogens.},

	abstract = {A considerable amount of disease is transmitted from animals to humans and many of these zoonoses are neglected tropical diseases. As outbreaks of {SARS}, avian influenza and Ebola have demonstrated, however, zoonotic diseases are serious threats to global public health and are not just problems confined to remote regions. There are two fundamental, and poorly studied, stages of zoonotic disease emergence: ‘spillover’, i.e. transmission of pathogens from animals to humans, and ‘stuttering transmission’, i.e. when limited human-to-human infections occur, leading to self-limiting chains of transmission. We developed a transparent, theoretical framework, based on a generalization of Poisson processes with memory of past human infections, that unifies these stages. Once we have quantified pathogen dynamics in the reservoir, with some knowledge of the mechanism of contact, the approach provides a tool to estimate the likelihood of spillover events. Comparisons with independent agent-based models demonstrates the ability of the framework to correctly estimate the relative contributions of human-to-human vs animal transmission. As an illustrative example, we applied our model to Lassa fever, a rodent-borne, viral haemorrhagic disease common in West Africa, for which data on human outbreaks were available. The approach developed here is general and applicable to a range of zoonoses. This kind of methodology is of crucial importance for the scientific, medical and public health communities working at the interface between animal and human diseases to assess the risk associated with the disease and to plan intervention and appropriate control measures. The Lassa case study revealed important knowledge gaps, and opportunities, arising from limited knowledge of the temporal patterns in reporting, abundance of and infection prevalence in, the host reservoir.},

Some ecologists focus on the role of environmental effects, whereas others argue that density-dependent feedback mechanisms are central3,4,5,6. The relative importance of both processes is still hotly debated, but clear examples of both processes acting in the same population are rare7,8. Key-factor analysis (regression of population changes on possible causal factors) and time-series analysis are often used to investigate the presence of density dependence, but such approaches may be biased and provide no information on actual demographic rates9,10. Here we report on both density-dependent and density-independent effects in a murid rodent pest species, the multimammate rat Mastomys natalensis (Smith, 1834), using statistical capture–recapture models. Both effects occur simultaneously, but we also demonstrate that they do not affect all demographic rates in the same way. We have incorporated the obtained estimates of demographic rates in a population dynamics model and show that the observed dynamics are affected by stabilizing nonlinear density-dependent components coupled with strong deterministic and stochastic seasonal components.},

A sequence similarity search and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the M. natalensis mitochondrial {DNA} belongs to the A-{III} lineage. We characterised the complete virus genome, which showed typical mammarenavirus organisation. Phylogenetic analysis indicated it clusters with Gairo virus found in M. natalensis B-{IV} in Tanzania, while showing sufficient divergence from other mammarenaviruses to be considered as a new species, for which we proposed the name Dhati Welel. Additional sampling in the M. natalensis A-{III} phylogeographic range should help determine whether the detection of the virus in M. awashensis represents a local spill-over or if the virus circulates in both Mastomys species.},

The Mano River region (Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Côte d’Ivoire) has been an endemic focus of the disease over the past decades. Here, we deciphered the genetic basis underlying {LF} endemics in this region. Clade model and type I functional divergence analyses revealed that the major {LASV} group, Kenema sub-clade, which is currently circulating in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone, has been affected by different selective pressure compared to isolates from the other areas with effects on the viral {RNA}-dependent {RNA} polymerase (L protein) and probably nucleoprotein ({NP}). Further, contingency analysis showed that, in the early endemic, the sub-clade has undergone adaptive diversification via acceleration of amino acid substitutions in L protein. These findings highlight the key viral factor and local adaptation regarding the endemicity of {LF}.},

	abstract = {Lassa virus is genetically diverse with several lineages circulating in West Africa. This study aimed at describing the sequence variability of Lassa virus across Nigeria and inferring its spatiotemporal evolution. We sequenced and isolated 77 Lassa virus strains from 16 Nigerian states. The final data set, including previous works, comprised metadata and sequences of 219 unique strains sampled between 1969 and 2018 in 22 states. Most of this data originated from Lassa fever patients diagnosed at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Edo State, Nigeria. The majority of sequences clustered with the main Nigerian lineages {II} and {III}, while a few sequences formed a new cluster related to Lassa virus strains from Hylomyscus pamfi. Within lineages {II} and {III}, seven and five sublineages, respectively, were distinguishable. Phylogeographic analysis suggests an origin of lineage {II} in the southeastern part of the country around Ebonyi State and a main vector of dispersal toward the west across the Niger River, through Anambra, Kogi, Delta, and Edo into Ondo State. The frontline of virus dispersal appears to be in Ondo. Minor vectors are directed northeast toward Taraba and Adamawa and south toward Imo and Rivers. Lineage {III} might have spread from northern Plateau State into Kaduna, Nasarawa, Federal Capital Territory, and Bauchi. One sublineage moved south and crossed the Benue River into Benue State. This study provides a geographic mapping of lineages and phylogenetic clusters in Nigeria at a higher resolution. In addition, we estimated the direction and time frame of virus dispersal in the country.
{IMPORTANCE} Lassa virus is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever with a case fatality rate of approximately 30\% in Africa. Previous studies disclosed a geographical pattern in the distribution of Lassa virus strains and a westward movement of the virus across West Africa during evolution. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the geography of genetic lineages and sublineages of the virus in Nigeria. In addition, we modeled how the virus spread in the country. This knowledge allows us to predict into which geographical areas the virus might spread in the future and prioritize areas for Lassa fever surveillance. Our study not only aimed to generate Lassa virus sequences from across Nigeria but also to isolate and conserve the respective viruses for future research. Both isolates and sequences are important for the development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to treat and prevent Lassa fever, such as diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.},

The availability of full genome sequences continues to increase, allowing for a more complete phylogenetic comparison of the isolates from Mali and the Ivory Coast to the other existing isolates. In this study, we utilized a Bayesian approach to infer the demographic histories of each {LASV} isolate for which the full sequence was available. Our results indicate that the isolates from Mali and the Ivory Coast group separately from the isolates of lineage {IV}, comprising a distinct fifth lineage.

Comparison of this structure with the structures of other arenavirus glycoprotein subunits reveals surprising findings: that the receptor binding subunit, {GP}1, of Lassa virus is conformationally labile, while the {GP}1 subunit of New World arenaviruses is not, and that the arenavirus {GPC} adopts a trimeric state unlike other glycoproteins with similar fusion machinery.

	abstract = {Lassa virus is endemic to West Africa and causes hemorrhagic fever in humans. To facilitate the functional analysis of this virus, a replicon system was developed based on Lassa virus strain {AV}. Genomic and antigenomic minigenomes ({MG}) were constructed consisting of the intergenic region of S {RNA} and a reporter gene (Renilla luciferase) in antisense orientation, flanked by the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of S {RNA}. {MGs} were expressed under the control of the T7 promoter. Nucleoprotein ({NP}), L protein, and Z protein were expressed from plasmids containing the T7 promoter and internal ribosomal entry site. Transfection of cells stably expressing T7 {RNA} polymerase ({BSR} T7/5) with {MG} in the form of {DNA} or {RNA} and plasmids for the expression of {NP} and L protein resulted in high levels of Renilla luciferase expression. The replicon system was optimized with respect to the ratio of the transfected constructs and by modifying the 5′ end of the {MG}. Maximum activity was observed 24 to 36 h after transfection with a signal-to-noise ratio of 2 to 3 log units. Northern blot analysis provided evidence for replication and transcription of the {MG}. Z protein downregulated replicon activity close to background levels. Treatment with ribavirin and alpha interferon inhibited replicon activity, suggesting that both act on the level of {RNA} replication, transcription, or ribonucleoprotein assembly. In conclusion, this study describes the first replicon system for a highly pathogenic arenavirus. It is a tool for investigating the mechanisms of replication and transcription of Lassa virus and may facilitate the testing of antivirals outside a biosafety level 4 laboratory.},

In contrast, no more than 30\% of the Hartley guinea pigs died regardless of the virus dose. In lethally infected strain 13 guinea pigs, peak titers of virus (10(7) to 10(8) {PFU}) occurred in the spleen and lymph nodes at 8 to 9 days, in the salivary glands at 11 days, and in the lung at 14 to 16 days.

The immune response of lethally infected strain 13 guinea pigs, as measured by the indirect fluorescent antibody test, was detectable within 10 days of infection and was similar in timing and intensity to the fluorescent antibody test response of both lethally infected and surviving outbred animals. In contrast to the fluorescent antibody response, neutralizing antibody developed late in convalescence and was thus detected only in surviving outbred guinea pigs. The availability of a rodent model for human Lassa fever in uniformly susceptible strain 13 guinea pigs should facilitate detailed pathophysiological studies and efficacy testing of antiviral drugs, candidate vaccines, and immunotherapy regimens to develop control methods for this life-threatening disease in humans.},

The clinical course varied from mild disease to severe illness with haemorrhagic disorders. The fatality rate was 14\%. The occurrence of only two possible secondary cases suggests that person-to-person spread of the disease is unimportant epidemiologically. There was a wide range of patients' ages, tribes, and occupations, including a 2 months old baby and a white {US} citizen. Clinical, laboratory, and histopathological investigations demonstrated the panorganotropism of Lassa virus. Haematological tests in few selected haemorrhagic cases with Lassa fever did not support coagulation disorders or thrombocytopenia as causing the bleeding tendency. The histopathologic changes bear resemblance to those observed in Argentinian and Bolivian haemorrhagic fever, both being caused by viruses of the Arena group. However, Lassa virus hepatitis may be differentiated from liver lesions occurring in yellow fever, Marburg virus disease, and Ebola (Maridi) haemorrhagic fever.},

	abstract = {Although an association between Lassa fever ({LF}) and sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss ({SNHL}) was confirmed clinically in 1990, the prevalence of {LF}-induced {SNHL} in endemic countries is still underestimated. {LF}, a viral hemorrhagic fever disease caused by Lassa virus ({LASV}), is endemic in West Africa, causing an estimated 500,000 cases and 5,000 deaths per year. Sudden-onset {SNHL}, one complication of {LF}, occurs in approximately one-third of survivors and constitutes a neglected public health and social burden. In the endemic countries, where access to hearing aids is limited, {SNHL} results in a decline of the quality of life for those affected. In addition, hearing loss costs Nigeria approximately 43 million dollars per year. The epidemiology of {LF}-induced {SNHL} has not been characterized well. The complication of {LF} induced by {SNHL} is also an important consideration for vaccine development and treatments. However, research into the mechanism has been hindered by the lack of autopsy samples and relevant small animal models. Recently, the first animal model that mimics the symptoms of {SNHL} associated with {LF} was developed. Preliminary data from the new animal model as well as the clinical case studies support the mechanism of immune-mediated injury that causes {SNHL} in {LF} patients. This article summarizes clinical findings of hearing loss in {LF} patients highlighting the association between {LASV} infection and {SNHL} as well as the potential mechanism(s) for {LF}-induced {SNHL}. Further research is necessary to identify the mechanism and the epidemiology of {LF}-induced {SNHL}.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to describe the ocular findings, structural ocular complications, and vision impairment in a cohort of Lassa fever survivors in Kenema, Sierra Leone. A retrospective, uncontrolled, cross-sectional study of 31 Lassa fever survivors (62 eyes) who underwent an ophthalmic evaluation in January 2018 at the Kenema Government Hospital in Kenema, Sierra Leone was performed. Data collection included demographic information, ocular/systemic symptoms, visual acuity ({VA}), and ophthalmic examination findings. Main outcome measures included anterior and posterior segment ophthalmic manifestations and level of {VA} impairment in Lassa fever survivors. Anterior segment findings included cataract (18\%) and pterygium (2\%), while posterior segment manifestations consisted of glaucoma (6\%), preretinal hemorrhage (2\%), and lattice degeneration (2\%). Findings suggestive of prior sequelae of uveitis included chorioretinal scarring (5\%), retinal fibrosis (3\%), and vitreous opacity (2\%). Visual acuity was normal/mildly impaired in 53 eyes (85\%), moderately impaired in 6 eyes (10\%), and 3 eyes (5\%) were considered blind by the World Health Organization ({WHO}) criteria. Median {VA} was worse in Lassa fever survivors with ophthalmic disease findings (p{\textless}0.0001) for both anterior segment (p{\textless}0.0001) and posterior segment disease (p{\textless}0.013). Untreated cataract was a significant cause of visual acuity impairment (p{\textless}0.0001). Lassa fever survivors in this cohort were found to have cataract and posterior segment findings that potentially represent sequelae of uveitis associated with visual impairment. Future studies are warranted to improve our understanding of the spectrum of ocular disease in this emerging infectious disease of public health consequence.},

In addition, due to the potential utilization of Lassa virus as a bioterrorism agent, vaccines against the disease can be utilized as a counterterrorism measure. Developing antiviral compounds and vaccines against the disease requires understanding of the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and its disease course, including the signs, symptoms, complications, and sequelae. An important sequela of Lassa fever is ataxia. A few cases of postviral ataxia following Lassa fever have been described in the literature. This review focuses on highlighting these cases, the gaps in scientific knowledge where further research is needed, and possible ways of diagnosing postviral ataxia after Lassa fever in resource-limited settings.},

Despite increased awareness, to date only a single case of Lassa fever has been confirmed in Mali. We conducted a survey to determine the prevalence of {LASV} exposure among persons in 3 villages in southern Mali where the presence of infected rodents has been documented. {LASV} {IgG} seroprevalence ranged from 14.5\% to 44\% per village. No sex bias was noted; however, seropositivity rates increased with participant age.

Despite having common borders with Liberia and Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire has never reported any cases of Lassa fever. In March 2000, as part of a research project on {VHF}--mainly yellow fever, Lassa fever and Ebola fever--in Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire, an exploratory survey was conducted to assess knowledge about {VHF} and immunological status against Lassa virus among forest workers in the Duekoue and Guiglo regions. One hundred and sixty-three male forest workers were interviewed using a questionnaire designed to assess risk factors for {VHF} exposure and personal medical history over the last 12 months. Detection of {IgG} antibodies against Lassa virus was performed by immunofluorescence assay with Lassa virus antigens from the Josiah and Las/{AV} strains. The overall prevalence of {IgG} antibodies was 26\% (42/161). Among the Lassa {IgG} positive subjects, 38.5\% were loggers including 20\% that were positive at a serum dilution of 1/40 and 46.7\% were national park workers or forest rangers including 69\% that were positive at a dilution of 1/40 and more. Forty-one percent of subjects had heard of {VHF} including 14\% who attributed it to animals and 2\% who attributed it to plants. Contact with rodents was frequent and more than 50\% of subjects had either eaten or skinned rodents. Although the prevalence of anti-Lassa {IgG} antibodies seemed high in the study population, no conclusion can be about level of exposure to Lassa virus.},

	abstract = {Ribavirin is currently the standard of care for treating Lassa fever. However, the human clinical trial data supporting its use suffer from several serious flaws that render the results and conclusions unreliable. We performed a systematic review of available pre-clinical data and human pharmacokinetic data on ribavirin in Lassa. In in-vitro studies, the {EC}50 of ribavirin ranged from 0.6 μg/ml to 21.72 μg/ml and the {EC}90 ranged from 1.5 μg/ml to 29 μg/ml. The mean {EC}50 was 7 μg/ml and the mean {EC}90 was 15 μg/ml. Human {PK} data in patients with Lassa fever was sparse and did not allow for estimation of concentration profiles or pharmacokinetic parameters. Pharmacokinetic modelling based on healthy human data suggests that the concentration profiles of current ribavirin regimes only exceed the mean {EC}50 for less than 20\% of the time and the mean {EC}90 for less than 10\% of the time, raising the possibility that the current ribavirin regimens in clinical use are unlikely to reliably achieve serum concentrations required to inhibit Lassa virus replication. The results of this review highlight serious issues with the evidence, which, by today standards, would be unlikely to support the transition of ribavirin from pre-clinical studies to human clinical trials. Additional pre-clinical studies are needed before embarking on expensive and challenging clinical trials of ribavirin in Lassa fever., Lassa fever is a viral disease endemic to West Africa that has been highlighted by the World Health Organisation as one of the top ten epidemic threats to global health. Ribavirin has been used to treat Lassa fever for more than 30 years. However, the clinical evidence for ribavirin is poor. We conducted a systematic review of the pre-clinical and human pharmacokinetic data in Lassa. We found that the minimum concentrations of ribavirin that inhibited Lassa virus replication varied hugely according to the experimental design and the type of cell and Lassa virus strain used. There was no comprehensive data on the concentrations of ribavirin in the blood of Lassa fever patients. Modelling of ribavirin concentration data from healthy humans suggest that the doses of ribavirin currently used to treat Lassa fever patients do not reliably achieve the concentrations required to inhibit viral replication.},

Intensified research and development of Lassa fever medical countermeasures have yielded some vaccine candidates with preclinical scientific plausibility using predominantly novel technology. The more advanced candidates are based on recombinant measles, Vesicular Stomatitis Virus or Mopiea and Lassa virus reassortants expressing Lassa virus antigens, and the deoxyribonucleic acid platform.

	abstract = {Background Lassa fever ({LF}), a haemorrhagic illness caused by the Lassa fever virus ({LASV}), is endemic in West Africa and causes 5000 fatalities every year. The true prevalence and incidence rates of {LF} are unknown as infections are often asymptomatic, clinical presentations are varied, and surveillance systems are not robust. The aim of the Enable Lassa research programme is to estimate the incidences of {LASV} infection and {LF} disease in five West African countries. The core protocol described here harmonises key study components, such as eligibility criteria, case definitions, outcome measures, and laboratory tests, which will maximise the comparability of data for between-country analyses. Method We are conducting a prospective cohort study in Benin, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria (three sites), and Sierra Leone from 2020 to 2023, with 24 months of follow-up. Each site will assess the incidence of {LASV} infection, {LF} disease, or both. When both incidences are assessed the {LASV} cohort (nmin = 1000 per site) will be drawn from the {LF} cohort (nmin = 5000 per site). During recruitment participants will complete questionnaires on household composition, socioeconomic status, demographic characteristics, and {LF} history, and blood samples will be collected to determine {IgG} {LASV} serostatus. {LF} disease cohort participants will be contacted biweekly to identify acute febrile cases, from whom blood samples will be drawn to test for active {LASV} infection using {RT}-{PCR}. Symptom and treatment data will be abstracted from medical records of {LF} cases. {LF} survivors will be followed up after four months to assess sequelae, specifically sensorineural hearing loss. {LASV} infection cohort participants will be asked for a blood sample every six months to assess {LASV} serostatus ({IgG} and {IgM}). Discussion Data on {LASV} infection and {LF} disease incidence in West Africa from this research programme will determine the feasibility of future Phase {IIb} or {III} clinical trials for {LF} vaccine candidates.},

	abstract = {Globally, the prevailing {COVID}-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented clinical and public health concerns with increasing morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, the burden of {COVID}-19 in Africa has been further exacerbated by the simultaneous epidemics of Ebola virus disease ({EVD}) and Lassa Fever ({LF}) which has created a huge burden on African healthcare systems. As Africa struggles to contain the spread of the second (and third) waves of the {COVID}-19 pandemic, the number of reported cases of {LF} is also increasing, and recently, new outbreaks of {EVD}. Before the pandemic, many of Africa’s frail healthcare systems were already overburdened due to resource limitations in staffing and infrastructure, and also, multiple endemic tropical diseases. However, the shared epidemiological and pathophysiological features of {COVID}-19, {EVD} and {LF} as well their simultaneous occurrence in Africa may result in misdiagnosis at the onset of infection, an increased possibility of co-infection, and rapid and silent community spread of the virus(es). Other challenges include high population mobility across porous borders, risk of human-to-animal transmission and reverse zoonotic spread, and other public health concerns. This review highlights some major clinical and public health challenges toward responses to the {COVID}-19 pandemic amidst the deuce-ace of recurrent {LF} and {EVD} epidemics in Africa. Applying the One Health approach in infectious disease surveillance and preparedness is essential in mitigating emerging and re-emerging (co-)epidemics in Africa and beyond.},

	shorttitle = {Beyond Lassa Fever},
	abstract = {Background Lassa fever ({LF}) often presents clinically as undifferentiated febrile illness. Lassa Fever cases in Sierra Leone have been falling since the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic. Data from other {LF} endemic countries suggest that this is not a true reflection of local epidemiological decline, but rather a function of either health seeking behaviour or the health/referral system. In Sierra Leone, many other diseases present with a similar early clinical picture, including {COVID}-19 and Marburg Disease (which has recently emerged in neighbouring Guinea). This empirical study explores the implementation of health system processes associated with International Health Regulations ({IHR}) requirements for early detection and timely and effective responses to the spread of febrile disease, through the case study of {LF} in Sierra Leone. Methodology/Principal findings This study used a qualitative approach to analyse local policy and guidance documents, key informant interviews with policy and practice actors, and focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with health care workers ({HCWs}) and community health workers ({CHWs}) in Kenema District to examine the ways in which undifferentiated fever surveillance and response policies and processes were implemented in the post-Ebola period. Multiple challenges were identified, including: issues with the {LF} case definition, approaches to differential diagnosis, specimen transport and the provision of results, and ownership of laboratory data. These issues lead to delays in diagnosis, and potentially worse outcomes for individual patients, as well as affecting the system’s ability to respond to outbreak-prone disease. Conclusions/Significance Identification of ways to improve the system requires balancing vertical disease surveillance programmes against other population health needs. Therefore, health system challenges to early identification of {LF} specifically have implications for the effectiveness of the wider Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response ({IDSR}) system in Sierra Leone more generally. Sentinel surveillance or improved surveillance at maternity facilities would help improve viral haemorrhagic fever ({VHF}) surveillance, as well as knowledge of {LF} epidemiology. Strengthening surveillance for vertical disease programmes, if correctly targeted, could have downstream benefits for {COVID}-19 surveillance and response as well as the wider health system—and therefore patient outcomes more generally.},

The β-generation is born in the main breeding season but reproduces already after abundant off-season rainfall. Its offspring, the γ-generation, is born in the off-season breeding period and breeds in the same year. Life histories of these three generation types are different. Generation α has a long growth stop, poor survival until breeding but up to six consecutive litters; generation β has a short growth stop, a better survival until reproduction but breeds only once or twice. The γ-generation, however, grows very fast and reproduces at young age. Through their daughters, the β-generation thus produces more than seven times as much young as the α-generation before the end of the following year. The occurrence of these generation types partially explains the relationship between rainfall patterns and population fluctuations.},

	abstract = {The diet and breeding patterns of Mastomys natalensis in semi-arid areas of Isimani division, Iringa region, Tanzania were investigated in maize fields and fallow land. The aim was to investigate the influence of diet on breeding patterns of M. natalensis. Removal trapping was used to capture rodents and analyse diet categories while Capture-mark-release trapping was used to investigate breeding patterns of female M. natalensis. Mastomys natalensis comprised 94\% of the total capture, and the remaining 6\% comprised of six other species. Statistical analysis of food preferences indicated that both vegetative materials and seeds were significantly higher in the overall diet of M. natalensis compared with other food materials. Significant differences in the proportions of vegetative materials and seeds were found between seasons (dry, wet), but not between habitats (fallow, maize). There was a clear seasonal pattern in the proportion of reproductively active females with peaks in April and troughs in October. The proportion of vegetative materials was highest during the wet season and correlated positively with reproductive activity, suggesting that vegetative materials contain certain compounds (e.g. 6-{MBOA}) that trigger reproductive activity in M. natalensis. The breeding activity of M. natalensis in semi-arid areas might, thus, be reduced by limiting access to fresh vegetative food (e.g. young sprouting grass).},

This study aimed at generating information on the population fluctuation and breeding patterns of M. natalensis in a maize dominated agro-ecosystem in the Mayuge district, Eastern Uganda. The area is characterised by a bimodal rainfall pattern with rains in the periods March to May and August to November. A Capture–Mark–Recapture study was established in cultivated and fallow field habitats with, in each habitat, two plots of 60 m by 60 m with 49 evenly spaced trapping points. Trapping was conducted monthly for three consecutive nights, and the study extended from January 2016 to June 2018. A Generalised Linear Mixed Model analysis showed significantly higher population density estimates (β = 0.69, p{\textless}0.0001) in fallow land compared to cultivated fields, and also significantly higher density estimates( β = 0.75, p = 0.006) in the first wet season and lowest in the first dry season. The percentage breeding females differed significantly across months (χ 2 = 27.05, df = 11, p = 0.003) and seasons (χ 2 = 17.64, p = 0.0003). Breeding females occurred throughout all the months of trapping, but with significantly higher percentages in the months of March to July (i.e. first wet season extending to second dry season) and generally lowest in the first dry months (i.e. January and February in 2017, and February 2018). The results of this study have important consequences for the timing of control efforts, and recommends that control should be initiated during the dry seasons prior to wet seasons to counteract potential damaging population build up in later wet seasons when crop planting is expected.},

Location Sahel and Sudan savannas, Africa. Methods We sequenced the whole cytochrome b gene in 211 individuals from 59 localities distributed from Senegal to Ethiopia. Sequence data were analysed using both phylogenetic (several rooted tree-construction methods, median-joining networks) and population genetic methods (spatial analyses of molecular variance, mismatch distributions). Results Haplotypes were distributed into four major monophyletic groups corresponding to distinct geographical regions across a west–east axis. Diversification events were estimated to have occurred between 1.16 and 0.18 Ma. Main conclusions Vicariance events related to the fragmentation of savanna habitats during the Pleistocene era may explain the phylogeographical patterns observed. Genetic structure was consistent with a role of major Sahelian rivers as significant barriers to west–east dispersal.

Although this group has long been recognized for its extensive chromosomal diversity, the highly conserved morphology of its members has made taxonomic assignments problematic. Renewed interest resulting from a series of cytogenetic and molecular investigations has led to the identification of novel patterns of diversification in these rodents that are reviewed herein. These approaches have considerably improved species delimitation and provide tentative diagnostic criteria as well as preliminary phylogenetic relationships that will be refined as more taxa are investigated. Although sparse, ecological data suggest that pygmy mice may exhibit original reproductive traits that deserve further investigation. Chromosomal diversity undoubtedly remains one of the most interesting features of African pygmy mouse biology. They display several karyotypic traits that are rare in mammals: (i) their genomes tolerate the recurrent formation of tandem fusions and sex-autosome translocations, both of which are rare in other mammals due to their highly deleterious effects on fertility; (ii) they exhibit the first case of a whole arm exchange involving an X chromosome, and (iii) two species show novel means of sex chromosome determination – one exhibits {XY} females, whereas the other harbors populations in which males have no Y chromosome. The diversity of African pygmy mice offers a unique opportunity to study the processes involved in their radiation, and in a broader context, the evolution of sex chromosome determination in mammals.},

We used powder tracking to determine how M. minutoides selected habitat at a fine scale and a broader path scale. At the fine scale, we measured per cent cover of grass and shrubs, the number of forbs and visual obstruction ({VO}) at five evenly spaced points along a mouse's pathway and at a paired random location. At the path scale, we calculated the relative displacement ({RD}) of each path as the ratio of the distance from the start to the end point of the path to the total length of the path (values near one indicate less preference). We found that M. minutoides were positively associated with increases in visual obstruction, grass cover, and shrub cover at the fine scale, but not at the path scale. Our results indicate that M. minutoides selection of vegetative features at the path scale is not as important as their fine-scale selection of vegetative structure. In addition, the shrub encroachment on our study site may be directly beneficial to M. minutoides at the fine scale. Our results provide us with an increased understanding of the basic ecology of M. minutoides and information on their response to a changing landscape.},

Six mitochondrial lineages showed a fine-scale phylogeographical pattern, whereas delimitation based on nuclear loci pooled four of them into a single widespread unit. A newly discovered lineage from southern Mauritania stands apart from the rest of the complex and might represent an unrecognized species. At the same time, the internal position of P. derooi (C2 mitochondrial lineage) was confirmed by the multilocus analysis. The magnitude of genetic distances between major phylogeographical lineages was typical for interspecific divergence in other clades of Praomys, despite the little differences among them in morphology (skull and upper molar row shapes). The most pronounced morphological shift was associated with a transition to commensalism, especially in P. derooi, but also in other lineages. This makes the whole complex a suitable model for the study of phenotypic novelty, the evolution of commensalism and conditions for ecological speciation.},

	abstract = {Two sibling species of the rodent genus Praomys occur in West African forests: P. tullbergi and P. rostratus. By sampling across their geographical ranges (459 individuals from 77 localities), we test the hypothesis that climatic oscillations during the Quaternary made an impact on the observed pattern of cytochrome b sequence variation. We show that, although these two species have parapatric geographical distributions, their phylogeographical histories are dissimilar, which could be related to their distinct ecological requirements. Since the arid phases of the Pleistocene were characterized by isolated forest patches, and intervening wetter periods by forest expansion, these changes in forest cover may be the common mechanism responsible for the observed phylogeographical patterns in both of these species. For example, in both species, most clades had either allopatric or parapatric geographical distributions; however, genetic diversity was much lower in P. tullbergi than in P. rostratus. The genetic pattern of P. tullbergi fits the refuge hypothesis, indicating that a very small number of populations survived in distinct forest blocks during the arid phases, then expanded again with forest recovery. In contrast, a number of populations of P. rostratus appear to have survived during the dry periods in more fragmented forest habitats, with varying levels of gene flow between these patches depending on climatic conditions and forest extent. In addition, historical variations of the West African hydrographic network could also have contributed to the pattern of genetic differentiation observed in both species.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the habitat preferences of small rodents and shrews from April 1984 to March 1985 in four types of vegetation in a lowland rain forest zone of Nigeria. The vegetation types were high forest, scrub, farmlands and teak plantations in Ogba Forest Reserve, Nigeria. A collection of 359 small mammals, consisting of six species of small rodents and four species of shrews, was made in the study area. The small rodents and their percentage composition were Mus musculoides (26.2\%), Praomys tullbergi (16.2\%), Mastomys natalensis (7.0\%), Lophuromys sikapusi (4.5\%), Lemniscomys striatus (2.5\%), and Arvicanthis niloticus (1.1\%). The shrews were Crocidura nigeriae (19.5\%), C. crossei (12.3\%), C.grandiceps (7.8\%) and C. ftavescens manni (3.1\%). The vegetational distribution of the small rodents and shrews is discussed. In the high forest, seven species of small mammals were caught; these were Crocidura nigeriae, C. crossei, C.grandiceps, C.flavescens manni, Mus musculoides, Praomys tullbergi and Lophuromys sikapusi. Mus musculoides, Crocidura nigeriae and Praomys tullbergi were more abundant in the high forest. All the species of small mammals recorded in the study area, except Arvicanthis niloticus, were found in the scrub. In the farmlands, all ten species of small mammals were trapped. Mus musculoides was the commonest species in the farmlands. Three species of shrews, Crocidura crossei, C. grandiceps and C.flavescens manni, and also two species of small rodents, Mus musculoides and Mastomys natalensis were caught in the teak plantation. The reproductive data for Mus musculoides, Crocidura nigeriae and Praomys tullbergi show that breeding in these species occurs throughout most months of the year. Fecundity appears to be maximal in the wet season in Mus musculoides and Crocidura nigeriae and in the dry season in the case of Praomys tullbergi.},

Electron microscopic appearance and serologic reactions placed it in the vaccinia subgroup of poxviruses. The isolate differed from ectromelia, rabbitpox, vaccinia, monkeypox, and cowpox viruses in pock morphology on chorioallantoic membrane, ceiling temperature, relative innocuity for mice, and cytopathic effect in tissue culture. Like variola minor virus, it had a ceiling temperature of 38 C, produced small hypertrophic foci in tissue culture, and failed to grow in rabbit skin. Inoculated into a rhesus monkey, it caused fever but no skin eruption and produced sero-conversion and protection from subsequent challenge with monkeypox virus. The growing list of animal viruses that differ only slightly from smallpox virus suggests the hypothesis that long-term survival of variola virus may be based on inapparent infection in animals as well as virulent spread among humans.},

Limitations of phylogeographic and zooarchaeological studies are highlighted, then how integration would increase understanding of species’ demographic histories and resultant inferences about human societies is discussed. How rat expansions have informed the understanding of human migration, urban settlements, trade networks, and intra- and interspecific competition is reviewed. Since each rat species is associated with different human societies, they identify unique ecological and historical/cultural conditions that influenced their expansion.

Sampling bias in geographic space leads to localities that may also be biased in environmental space. If so, the model can overfit to those biases. As a preliminary test addressing this issue, we used Maxent, bioclimatic variables, and occurrence localities of a broadly distributed Malagasy tenrec, Microgale cowani (Tenrecidae: Oryzorictinae). We modeled the abiotically suitable area of this species using three distinct datasets: unfiltered, spatially filtered, and rarefied unfiltered localities. To quantify overfitting and model performance, we calculated evaluation {AUC}, the difference between calibration and evaluation {AUC} (={AUCdiff}), and omission rates. Models made with the filtered dataset showed lower overfitting and better performance than the other two suites of models, having lower omission rates and {AUCdiff}, and a higher {AUCevaluation}. Additionally, the rarefied unfiltered dataset performed better than the unfiltered one for three evaluation metrics, likely because the larger one reinforced the biases. These results indicate that spatial filtering of occurrence localities may allow biogeographers to produce better models.},

Genomic data and phylogenetic reconstructions were communicated immediately to Nigerian authorities and the World Health Organization to inform the public health response. Real-time analysis of 36 genomes and subsequent confirmation using all 120 samples sequenced in the country of origin revealed extensive diversity and phylogenetic intermingling with strains from previous years, suggesting independent zoonotic transmission events and thus allaying concerns of an emergent strain or extensive human-to-human transmission.},

Here, I show that climate change and agricultural expansion interact synergistically in their impacts on mammals across mega-biodiverse Southeast Asia. Rising temperatures do not directly reduce niche availability for most species but do trigger a major altitudinal expansion in the cultivation zone for oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), a cold-intolerant crop tree that is currently restricted to tropical lowlands. The resulting replacement of native forests would reduce mammal ranges by 47–67\% by 2070, given a low- or high-carbon-emissions trajectory, respectively. This reduction is 3–4 times the magnitude of that predicted from land-use change without considering climatic effects. The synergistic interaction between climate change and land-use change greatly outweighs the impact on biodiversity of either factor alone or their additive combination.},

The extent to which this shifting focus has tracked the most eminent threats to biodiversity is not well documented. We investigated the mechanisms driving shifts in the southern range boundary of a forest and snow cover specialist, the snowshoe hare, to explore how its range boundary has responded to shifting rates of climate and land cover change over time. We found that although both forest and snow cover contributed to the historical range boundary, the current duration of snow cover best explains the most recent northward shift, while forest cover has declined in relative importance. In this respect, the southern range boundary of snowshoe hares has mirrored the focus of conservation research; first habitat loss and fragmentation was the stronger environmental constraint, but climate change has now become the main threat. Projections of future range shifts show that climate change, and associated snow cover loss, will continue to be the major driver of this species' range loss into the future.},

This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change, a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes, and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably will have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change.},

These two stressors are likely to interact, but how climate change will mediate the effects of land-cover change remains poorly understood. Here we use an empirically-derived model of the interaction between habitat loss and climate to predict the implications of this for biodiversity loss and conservation priorities at a global scale. Risk analysis was used to estimate the risk of biodiversity loss due to alternative future land-cover change scenarios and to quantify how climate change mediates this risk. We demonstrate that the interaction of climate change with land-cover change could increase the impact of land-cover change on birds and mammals by up to 43\% and 24\% respectively and alter the spatial distribution of threats. Additionally, we show that the ranking of global biodiversity hotspots by threat depends critically on the interaction between climate change and habitat loss. Our study suggests that the investment of conservation resources will likely change once the interaction between climate change and land-cover change is taken into account. We argue that global conservation efforts must take this into account if we are to develop cost-effective conservation policies and strategies under global change.},

	abstract = {Human-mediated changes to natural ecosystems have consequences for both ecosystem and human health. Historically, efforts to preserve or restore ‘biodiversity’ can seem to be in opposition to human interests. However, the integration of biodiversity conservation and public health has gained significant traction in recent years, and new efforts to identify solutions that benefit both environmental and human health are ongoing. At the forefront of these efforts is an attempt to clarify ways in which biodiversity conservation can help reduce the risk of zoonotic spillover of pathogens from wild animals, sparking epidemics and pandemics in humans and livestock. However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which biodiversity change influences the spillover process is incomplete, limiting the application of integrated strategies aimed at achieving positive outcomes for both conservation and disease management. Here, we review the literature, considering a broad scope of biodiversity dimensions, to identify cases where zoonotic pathogen spillover is mechanistically linked to changes in biodiversity. By reframing the discussion around biodiversity and disease using mechanistic evidence — while encompassing multiple aspects of biodiversity including functional diversity, landscape diversity, phenological diversity, and interaction diversity — we work toward general principles that can guide future research and more effectively integrate the related goals of biodiversity conservation and spillover prevention. We conclude by summarizing how these principles could be used to integrate the goal of spillover prevention into ongoing biodiversity conservation initiatives.},

Because they are transmitted to humans from non-human animals, the transmission dynamics of zoonoses are necessarily influenced by the ecology of their animal hosts and vectors. The ‘dilution effect’ proposes that increased species diversity reduces disease risk, suggesting that conservation and public health initiatives can work synergistically to improve human health and wildlife biodiversity. However, the meta-analysis that we present here indicates a weak and highly heterogeneous relationship between host biodiversity and disease. Our results suggest that disease risk is more likely a local phenomenon that relies on the specific composition of reservoir hosts and vectors, and their ecology, rather than patterns of species biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Understanding the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on zoonotic disease risk is both a critical conservation objective and a public health priority. Here, we evaluate the effects of multiple forms of anthropogenic disturbance across a precipitation gradient on the abundance of pathogen-infected small mammal hosts in a multi-host, multi-pathogen system in central Kenya. Our results suggest that conversion to cropland and wildlife loss alone drive systematic increases in rodent-borne pathogen prevalence, but that pastoral conversion has no such systematic effects. The effects are most likely explained both by changes in total small mammal abundance, and by changes in relative abundance of a few high-competence species, although changes in vector assemblages may also be involved. Several pathogens responded to interactions between disturbance type and climatic conditions, suggesting the potential for synergistic effects of anthropogenic disturbance and climate change on the distribution of disease risk. Overall, these results indicate that conservation can be an effective tool for reducing abundance of rodent-borne pathogens in some contexts (e.g. wildlife loss alone); however, given the strong variation in effects across disturbance types, pathogen taxa and environmental conditions, the use of conservation as public health interventions will need to be carefully tailored to specific pathogens and human contexts.

	abstract = {The twin concepts of zooprophylaxis and the dilution effect originated with vector-borne diseases (malaria), were driven forward by studies on Lyme borreliosis and have now developed into the mantra “biodiversity protects against disease”. The basic idea is that by diluting the assemblage of transmission-competent hosts with non-competent hosts, the probability of vectors feeding on transmission-competent hosts is reduced and so the abundance of infected vectors is lowered. The same principle has recently been applied to other infectious disease systems – tick-borne, insect-borne, indirectly transmitted via intermediate hosts, directly transmitted. It is claimed that the presence of extra species of various sorts, acting through a variety of distinct mechanisms, causes the prevalence of infectious agents to decrease. Examination of the theoretical and empirical evidence for this hypothesis reveals that it applies only in certain circumstances even amongst tick-borne diseases, and even less often if considering the correct metric – abundance rather than prevalence of infected vectors. Whether dilution or amplification occurs depends more on specific community composition than on biodiversity per se. We warn against raising a straw man, an untenable argument easily dismantled and dismissed. The intrinsic value of protecting biodiversity and ecosystem function outweighs this questionable utilitarian justification.},

Research frontiers include the importance of rodent population density to the incidence of human disease, as opposed to behavior or age structure effects; the roles of different types of predators in determining both population dynamics and rodent density per se; and the effects of human-caused environmental change on predators and their rodent prey.

	abstract = {Intensification of agriculture is an increasing threat for biodiversity. Central Romania still preserves a traditional rural landscape with a matrix of small plots of crops and large surfaces covered by grasslands and forests, but its biodiversity is very poorly studied. Small mammals are key components of agrarian and semi-natural ecosystems but rodents are also viewed as major pests. Knowledge of the driving factors of small mammal communities in agricultural landscapes may enable taking management measures that pursue both conservation and economic goals. Here we evaluate the response of small mammals to environmental variables, including vegetation characteristics, land use and geographic position. We conducted live trapping between June and October in habitats with different environmental characteristics and land uses. We found that vegetation traits were the most important factors influencing small mammal communities. Species composition was shaped mainly by tree cover, shrub cover had strong effects on community diversity and abundance, while the height of the herbaceous layer significantly influenced all the parameters. Among the agrarian land uses maize crops stood out for the abundance of mice, especially Mus musculus, and hayfields for Microtus arvalis. Land fallowing was linked to the increase of diversity and total abundance to the maximum values but did not significantly alter species composition. Species with low tolerance to tree cover were more prone to be abundant in agricultural lands, whereas the habitat generalists prevailed in non-agrarian lands. Our results suggest that preservation of the mosaic of farmed and semi-natural habitats and actions targeted for vegetation management, such as interspersing woody vegetation in the crop matrix and mowing the herbaceous vegetation in semi-natural habitats adjacent to crops, may together achieve the balance between biodiversity conservation and crop protection.},

However, it is largely unknown how these species use tropical anthropogenic landscapes originally covered with forests and inhabited by diverse small mammal assemblages. We surveyed non-flying small mammals in various urban and suburban habitat types and adjacent forest in the tropical town of Kota Kinabalu in Borneo. We used occupancy and polynomial regression models to determine variation in species occurrences along gradients of land-use intensity. Müller’s sundamys (Sundamys muelleri) was the only native small mammal species found in urban and suburban landscapes with a continuous decrease in occurrence probability from forests to urban habitats. The invasive Asian black rat (Rattus rattus species complex) and the invasive Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) had the highest occurrence probabilities in habitats of intermediate land-use intensity, but Asian black rats are also likely to occasionally invade forested habitats and occupied urban habitats in sympatry with the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus). In urban and suburban habitats, fallow land possibly favoured the occurrence of S. muelleri and S. murinus. Other native small mammal species (Muridae, Sciuridae, Tupaiidae) were found only in forested areas. Our study shows that native small mammals found in forest are largely replaced by invasive species in urban and suburban habitats. Due to their occurrence in habitats of various land use intensities, S. muelleri and R. rattus comprise central links between forest wildlife and urban species, an association that is important to consider in studies of parasite and disease transmission dynamics.},

Three of these (Mastomys natalensis, Saccostomus campestris and Aethomys chrysophilus) occur commonly. The hypothesis was investigated that habitat characteristics, and not species interactions, explain most of the variation in species-specific densities of these three species. Existing data were collated and the relationships between species-specific densities determined. In addition, a trapping programme was established between July 1993 and February 1995, during which species-specific densities were estimated and 16 habitat variables measured. Multiple regression analyses were used to investigate the relationship (i.e. not causation) between species-specific densities and a suite of habitat variables. No additional explanation of variation in species-specific densities by densities of other species were evident when habitat variables have been accounted for. It is concluded that most of the variation in species-specific densities of a Mastomys-Saccostomus-Aethomys assemblage can be explained by habitat variables rather than species interactions.},

	abstract = {Based on compiled small mammal trapping data collected over 12 years from Benin and Niger (3701 individual records from 66 sampling sites), located in mainland Africa, we here describe the small mammal community assemblage in urban habitats along the commercial axis connecting the two countries, from the seaport of Cotonou to the Sahelian hinterland, with a particular focus on invasive species. In doing so, we document extant species distributions, which highlight the risks of continuing the range expansion of three synanthropic invasive rodent species, namely black rats (Rattus rattus), brown rats (R. norvegicus), and house mice (Mus musculus). Using various diversity estimates and community ecology approaches, we detect a latitudinal gradient of species richness that significantly decreased Northward. We show that shrews (Crocidura) represent a very important component of micro-mammal fauna in West African towns and villages, especially at lower latitudes. We also demonstrate that invasive and native synanthropic rodents do not distribute randomly in West Africa, which suggests that invasive species dynamics and history differ markedly, and that they involve gradual, as well as human-mediated, long distance dispersal. Patterns of segregation are also observed between native Mastomys natalensis and invasive rats R. rattus and R. norvegicus, suggesting potential native-to-invasive species turn over. Consequences of such processes, especially in terms of public health, are discussed.},

Cities are important hubs for people and goods exchange and are thus expected to play a pivotal role in invasive commensal rodent dissemination. Yet, data about urban rodents' ecology, especially invasive vs. native species interactions, are dramatically scarce. Here, we provide results of an extensive survey of urban rodents conducted in Niamey, Niger, depicting the early stages of rodent bioinvasions within a city. We explore the species-specific spatial distributions throughout the city using contrasted approaches, namely field sampling, co-occurrence analysis, occupancy modelling and indicator geostatistics. We show that (i) two species (i.e. rural-like vs. truly commensal) assemblages can be identified, and that (ii) within commensal rodents, invasive (Rattus rattus and Mus musculus) and native (Mastomys natalensis) species are spatially segregated. Moreover, several pieces of arguments tend to suggest that these exclusive distributions reflect an ongoing native-to-invasive species turn over. The underlying processes as well as the possible consequences for humans are discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Scientific and societal unknowns make it difficult to predict how global environmental changes such as climate change and biological invasions will affect ecological systems. In the long term, these changes may have interacting effects and compound the uncertainty associated with each individual driver. Nonetheless, invasive species are likely to respond in ways that should be qualitatively predictable, and some of these responses will be distinct from those of native counterparts. We used the stages of invasion known as the “invasion pathway” to identify 5 nonexclusive consequences of climate change for invasive species: (1) altered transport and introduction mechanisms, (2) establishment of new invasive species, (3) altered impact of existing invasive species, (4) altered distribution of existing invasive species, and (5) altered effectiveness of control strategies. We then used these consequences to identify testable hypotheses about the responses of invasive species to climate change and provide suggestions for invasive-species management plans. The 5 consequences also emphasize the need for enhanced environmental monitoring and expanded coordination among entities involved in invasive-species management.},

	abstract = {Well-established theoretical models predict host density thresholds for invasion and persistence of parasites with a density-dependent transmission. Studying such thresholds in reality, however, is not obvious because it requires long-term data for several fluctuating populations of different size. We developed a spatially explicit and individual-based {SEIR} model of Mopeia virus in multimammate mice Mastomys natalensis. This is an interesting model system for studying abundance thresholds because the host is the most common African rodent, populations fluctuate considerably and the virus is closely related to Lassa virus but non-pathogenic to humans so can be studied safely in the field. The simulations show that, while host density clearly is important, sharp thresholds are only to be expected for persistence (and not for invasion), since at short time-spans (as during invasion), stochasticity is determining. Besides host density, also the spatial extent of the host population is important. We observe the repeated local occurrence of herd immunity, leading to a decrease in transmission of the virus, while even a limited amount of dispersal can have a strong influence in spreading and re-igniting the transmission. The model is most sensitive to the duration of the infectious stage, the size of the home range and the transmission coefficient, so these are important factors to determine experimentally in the future.},

The current trends resulting from anthropocene defaunation suggest that in the future they, along with other small mammals, are likely to become the dominant mammals in almost all human-modified environments. Recent intricate studies on bat-borne emerging diseases have highlighted that many gaps exist in our understanding of the zoonotic transmission of rodent-borne pathogens. This has emphasized the need for scientists interested in rodent-borne diseases to integrate rodent ecology into their analysis of rodent-borne pathogen transmission in order to identify in more detail the mechanisms of spillover and chains of transmission. Further studies are required to better understand the true impact of rodent abundance and the importance of pathogen sharing and circulation in multi-host– multi-pathogen communities. We also need to explore in more depth the roles of generalist and abundant species as the potential links between pathogen-sharing, co-infections and disease transmission.},

Five interdisciplinary case studies addressed zoonotic diseases in African settings: Rift Valley fever ({RVF}) in Kenya, human African trypanosomiasis in Zambia and Zimbabwe, Lassa fever in Sierra Leone and henipaviruses in Ghana. Each explored how ecological changes and human–ecosystem interactions affect pathogen dynamics and hence the likelihood of zoonotic spillover and transmission, and how socially differentiated peoples’ interactions with ecosystems and animals affect their exposure to disease. Cross-case analysis highlights how these dynamics vary by ecosystem type, across a range from humid forest to semi-arid savannah; the significance of interacting temporal and spatial scales; and the importance of mosaic and patch dynamics. Ecosystem interactions and services central to different people's livelihoods and well-being include pastoralism and agro-pastoralism, commercial and subsistence crop farming, hunting, collecting food, fuelwood and medicines, and cultural practices. There are synergies, but also tensions and trade-offs, between ecosystem changes that benefit livelihoods and affect disease. Understanding these can inform ‘One Health’ approaches towards managing ecosystems in ways that reduce disease risks and burdens.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Multimammate mice are the most important vertebrate pests in Sub-Saharan Africa and are also reservoirs of many zoonotic diseases, including sylvan plague. This study investigated the population dynamics and breeding patterns of this mouse in irrigated rice cropping systems in eastern Tanzania. {RESULTS}: The multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, population varied with habitat and months. Fallow land had a more abundant population than rice fields. The highest population peak was observed during the dry season from July to October. Mastomys natalensis is sexually active throughout the year in the study area, although it reaches the highest level in June and December when rice is at the maturity stage. This suggests that breeding is highly influenced by the presence of a rice crop in both seasons. More juvenile individuals were recorded in August and September, indicating that they were produced in the previous breeding months. The sex ratio of M. natalensis was not skewed to either males or females, indicating that it was at parity. {CONCLUSION}: Rodent population dynamics during the study periods in all habitats indicated that high birth rates accounted for the rapid population growth and turnover. Regular control and sustainable operations are thus essential if rodent pest populations are to be kept within tolerable limits. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry},

The common vole Microtus arvalis has recently colonized the agricultural plains of the northern Iberian Plateau, an area where it has started to produce population outbreaks with important impacts in agriculture, the environment and human health. Vole monitoring has become of prime importance to implement preventive management measures to control populations. In order to find a simple and reliable vole monitoring method to be applied in large areas, we compared abundance estimates derived from three methods: capture–mark–recapture ({CMR}), single capture events ({SCE}) and presence/absence of vole activity signs ({VAS}) during three seasons and on the main agricultural habitats in the study area. We show that an activity index based on the presence of fresh droppings and/or clippings had a similar performance to {SCE} in a large sample of plots (n=222) across habitats and seasons. Data obtained with both methods ({SCE}, {VAS}) were also well correlated with those obtained with {CMR}, despite a limited sample size (n=23 {CMR} plots). We suggest that the {VAS} method, which is a cheaper and easier alternative to trapping methods, provides a promising tool for scientists and managers to implement large scale monitoring of common vole in agricultural areas.},

	abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa arenavirus, the etiological agent of Lassa fever in humans. Because there exists no vaccine for human use, rodent control and adjusting human behavior are currently considered to be the only options for Lassa fever control. In order to develop efficient rodent control programs, more information about the host’s ecology is needed. In this study, we investigated the spatial behavior of M. natalensis and other small rodents in two capture-mark-recapture and four dyed bait (Rhodamine B) experiments in Lassa fever-endemic villages in Upper Guinea. During the capture-mark-recapture studies, 23\% of the recaptured M. natalensis moved between the houses and proximate fields. While M. natalensis was found over the entire study grid (2 ha), other rodent species (Praomys daltoni, Praomys rostratus, Lemniscomys striatus, Mus spp.) were mostly trapped in the surrounding fields. Distances between recapture occasions never exceeded 100 m for all rodent species. During the dyed bait experiments, 11\% of M. natalensis and 41\% of P. daltoni moved from the fields to houses. We conclude that commensal M. natalensis easily moves between houses and proximate fields in Guinea. We therefore consider occasional domestic rodent elimination to be an unsustainable approach to reduce Lassa virus transmission risk to humans, as M. natalensis is likely to reinvade houses quickly from fields in which rodents are not controlled. A combination of permanent rodent elimination with other control strategies (e.g., make houses rodent proof or attract predators) could be more effective for Lassa fever control, but must be further investigated.},

	abstract = {Exploration and activity are often described as trade-offs between the fitness benefits of gathering information and resources, and the potential costs of increasing exposure to predators and parasites. More exploratory individuals are predicted to have higher rates of parasitism, but this relationship has rarely been examined for virus infections in wild populations. Here, we used the multimammate mouse Mastomys natalensis to investigate the relationship between exploration, activity, and infection with Morogoro virus ({MORV}). We characterized individual exploratory behavior (open field and novel object tests) and activity (trap diversity), and quantified the relationship between these traits and infection status using linear regression. We found that M. natalensis expresses consistent individual differences, or personality types, in exploratory behavior (repeatability of 0.30, 95\% {CI}: 0.21–0.36). In addition, we found a significant contrasting effect of age on exploration and activity where juveniles display higher exploration levels than adults, but lower field-activity. There was however no statistical evidence for a behavioral syndrome between these 2 traits. Contrary to our expectations, we found no correlation between {MORV} infection status and exploratory behavior or activity, which suggests that these behaviors may not increase exposure probability to {MORV} infection. This would further imply that variation in viral infection between individuals is not affected by between-individual variation in exploration and activity.},

The aims of this study were to determine the relative importance of intra-group social interactions in the transmission of tuberculosis ({TB}; Mycobacterium bovis infection) in a population of wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) in South Africa, and to use this information to propose an evidence-based intervention strategy to manage this disease. Detailed behavioural observations of all members of eight meerkat groups (n=134 individuals) were made over 24 months from January 2006 to December 2007. Social network analysis of three types of interaction (aggression, foraging competitions and grooming) revealed social structure to be very stable over time. Clustering of interactions was positively correlated with group size for both aggression (r=0.73) and grooming interactions (r=0.71), suggesting that infections may spread locally within clusters of interacting individuals but be limited from infecting all members of large groups by an apparent threshold in connections between different clusters. Repeated biological sampling every three months of all members of one social group (n=37 meerkats) was undertaken to quantify individual changes in M. bovis infection status. These empirical data were used to construct a dynamic network model of {TB} transmission within a meerkat group. The results indicated that grooming (both giving and receiving) was more likely than aggression to be correlated with M. bovis transmission and that groomers were at higher risk of infection than groomees. Intervention strategies for managing {TB} in meerkats that focus on those individuals engaging in the highest amount of grooming are therefore proposed.},

The number of secondary infections produced by an infected individual is a function of three components: an individual’s infectiousness, the rate at which it contacts susceptible individuals and the duration of infection. Individual-level variation can emerge in each of these components through a combination of behavioural and physiological mechanisms. 3. In this review, we describe mechanisms that promote variation in the number of individuals to which an individual transmits a pathogen, emphasizing insights that can be gained by understanding which components of transmission (infectiousness, contact rate, infection duration) are primarily affected. We also discuss how behavioural and physiological processes generate transmission heterogeneities across multiple scales, from individual-level variation to heterogeneity among species. 4. Strategies for quantifying each transmission component are presented, and we discuss why studies focusing on only one component of the infection process may be misleading. 5. To conclude, we describe how future research focusing on variation in transmission across all three components can provide a more holistic view of heterogeneity in pathogen transmission.},

	abstract = {Highly lethal pathogens (e.g., hantaviruses, hendra virus, anthrax, or plague) pose unique public-health problems, because they seem to periodically flare into outbreaks before disappearing into long quiescent phases. A key element to their possible control and eradication is being able to understand where they persist in the latent phase and how to identify the conditions that result in sporadic epidemics or epizootics. In American grasslands, plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, exemplifies this quiescent–outbreak pattern, because it sporadically erupts in epizootics that decimate prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies, yet the causes of outbreaks and mechanisms for interepizootic persistence of this disease are poorly understood. Using field data on prairie community ecology, flea behavior, and plague-transmission biology, we find that plague can persist in prairie-dog colonies for prolonged periods, because host movement is highly spatially constrained. The abundance of an alternate host for disease vectors, the grasshopper mouse (Onychomys leucogaster), drives plague outbreaks by increasing the connectivity of the prairie dog hosts and therefore, permitting percolation of the disease throughout the primary host population. These results offer an alternative perspective on plague's ecology (i.e., disease transmission exacerbated by alternative hosts) and may have ramifications for plague dynamics in Asia and Africa, where a single main host has traditionally been considered to drive Yersinia ecology. Furthermore, abundance thresholds of alternate hosts may be a key phenomenon determining outbreaks of disease in many multihost-disease systems.},

	abstract = {1 Using field data published in the literature, we investigated pathogen dynamics and conditions of persistence in a mathematical model of the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus)–Puumala hantavirus system. The host population is assumed to have a 3-year periodic cycle. The duration of very low host density is critical for virus transmission and survival. 2 Field epidemiological data strongly suggested a transmission of the hantavirus by the contaminated environment. We thus studied whether this ‘indirect’ transmission affected the virus persistence in the host population. 3 The model assumptions were derived from the following conditions found in the literature: (1) there is no additional mortality nor fecundity loss due to the virus in infected hosts, thus the cyclic demographical pattern is not due to the virus; (2) no remission has been observed, thus we did not consider the existence of recovered individuals; (3) adult females are territorial and juveniles disperse to find a new territory and reach sexual maturity. A fragmented landscape was assumed to occur: individuals can live in favourable or unfavourable patches. 4 The model was a compartmental model; the population was structured into susceptible or infectious individuals. We considered two age classes, juveniles and adults, and two sites (populations) connected by juvenile dispersal. 5 Model dynamics accurately predicted the cyclic trend in disease prevalence as observed in epidemiological studies. They also showed that indirect transmission significantly increased the probability for the virus to persist during the low-density period of the host population. More precisely, even a low survival rate of the virus outside the host was sufficient to decrease extinction risk of the infection by stochastic events. 6 Elasticity analysis showed a high robustness of the model to changes in the parameters of indirect transmission but a high sensitivity to changes in adult density.},

	abstract = {Multi-host wildlife pathogens are an increasing concern for both wildlife conservation and livestock husbandry. Here, we combined social network theory with microbial genetics to assess patterns of interspecific pathogen transmission among ten species of wild and domestic ungulates in Kenya. If two individuals shared the same genetic subtype of a genetically diverse microbe, Escherichia coli, then we inferred that these individuals were part of the same transmission chain. Individuals in the same transmission chain were interlinked to create a transmission network. Given interspecific variation in physiology and behavior, some species may function as “super-spreaders” if individuals of that species are consistently central in the transmission network. Pathogen management strategies targeted at key super-spreader species are theoretically more effective at limiting pathogen spread than conventional strategies, and our approach provides a means to identify candidate super-spreaders in wild populations. We found that Grant’s gazelle (Gazella granti) typically occupied central network positions and were connected to a large number of other individuals in the network. Zebra (Equus burchelli), in contrast, seemed to function as bridges between regions of the network that would otherwise be poorly connected, and interventions targeted at zebra significantly increased the level of fragmentation in the network. Although not usually pathogenic, E. coli transmission pathways provide insight into transmission dynamics by demonstrating where contact between species is sufficient for transmission to occur and identifying species that are potential super-spreaders.},

	abstract = {As biodiversity declines with anthropogenic land-use change, it is increasingly important to understand how changing biodiversity affects infectious disease risk. The dilution effect hypothesis, which points to decreases in biodiversity as critical to an increase in infection risk, has received considerable attention due to the allure of a win–win scenario for conservation and human well-being. Yet some empirical data suggest that the dilution effect is not a generalizable phenomenon. We explore the response of pathogen transmission dynamics to changes in biodiversity that are driven by habitat loss using an allometrically scaled multi-host model. With this model, we show that declining habitat, and thus declining biodiversity, can lead to either increasing or decreasing infectious-disease risk, measured as endemic prevalence. Whether larger habitats, and thus greater biodiversity, lead to a decrease (dilution effect) or increase (amplification effect) in infection prevalence depends upon the pathogen transmission mode and how host competence scales with body size. Dilution effects were detected for most frequency-transmitted pathogens and amplification effects were detected for density-dependent pathogens. Amplification effects were also observed over a particular range of habitat loss in frequency-dependent pathogens when we assumed that host competence was greatest in large-bodied species. By contrast, only amplification effects were observed for density-dependent pathogens; host competency only affected the magnitude of the effect. These models can be used to guide future empirical studies of biodiversity–disease relationships across gradients of habitat loss. The type of transmission, the relationship between host competence and community assembly, the identity of hosts contributing to transmission, and how transmission scales with area are essential factors to consider when elucidating the mechanisms driving disease risk in shrinking habitat.

	abstract = {There are two popular statistical models for meta-analysis, the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model. The fact that these two models employ similar sets of formulas to compute statistics, and sometimes yield similar estimates for the various parameters, may lead people to believe that the models are interchangeable. In fact, though, the models represent fundamentally different assumptions about the data. The selection of the appropriate model is important to ensure that the various statistics are estimated correctly. Additionally, and more fundamentally, the model serves to place the analysis in context. It provides a framework for the goals of the analysis as well as for the interpretation of the statistics. In this paper we explain the key assumptions of each model, and then outline the differences between the models. We conclude with a discussion of factors to consider when choosing between the two models. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We analyzed trap data for 5 forest rodent species from 525 sites in 35 study landscapes throughout the upper Wabash River basin, which is dominated by agricultural use and drains {\textgreater}20\% of Indiana. We used a recently developed likelihood approach and multi-model inference to obtain unbiased estimates of occurrence probabilities for a species when detection rates are {\textless}1, and we used hierarchical generalized linear modeling to evaluate random effects associated with nested data structure. Inclusion of a spatial autocovariate term had important effects on model selection results for 4 of 5 species and improved fit of models. Eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), although previously described as sensitive to fragmentation, were nearly ubiquitous in our study region and had greater occupancy rates in smaller woodlots. Fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) are well adapted to patchy landscapes, and their occupancy rates actually increased with patch isolation. Gray squirrels (S. carolinensis) are adversely affected by forest fragmentation; we observed a threshold decline in occupancy rates beyond ∼15 km from the Wabash River, which harbors the only source of contiguous habitat within the entire river basin. Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) exhibited greater abundance in sites without gray squirrels. Moreover, their occupancy rates were positively related to habitat and landscapes considered suboptimal (e.g., lower basal area of hard-mast bearing trees, more isolated patches); this was further evidence for negative effects of gray squirrels on red squirrel populations. White-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) were nearly ubiquitous; although occurrence rates in less forested landscapes increased with distance from edge and greater volume of woody debris.},

	shorttitle = {Small-Mammal Density Estimation},
	abstract = {Statistical models for estimating absolute densities of field populations of animals have been widely used over the last century in both scientific studies and wildlife management programs. To date, two general classes of density estimation models have been developed: models that use data sets from capture–recapture or removal sampling techniques (often derived from trapping grids) from which separate estimates of population size ({NÌ}‚) and effective sampling area ({AÌ}‚) are used to calculate density ({DÌ}‚ = {NÌ}‚/{AÌ}‚); and models applicable to sampling regimes using distance-sampling theory (typically transect lines or trapping webs) to estimate detection functions and densities directly from the distance data. However, few studies have evaluated these respective models for accuracy, precision, and bias on known field populations, and no studies have been conducted that compare the two approaches under controlled field conditions. In this study, we evaluated both classes of density estimators on known densities of enclosed rodent populations. Test data sets (n = 11) were developed using nine rodent species from capture–recapture live-trapping on both trapping grids and trapping webs in four replicate 4.2-ha enclosures on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in central New Mexico, {USA}. Additional “saturation” trapping efforts resulted in an enumeration of the rodent populations in each enclosure, allowing the computation of true densities. Density estimates ({DÌ}‚) were calculated using program {CAPTURE} for the grid data sets and program {DISTANCE} for the web data sets, and these results were compared to the known true densities (D) to evaluate each model's relative mean square error, accuracy, precision, and bias. In addition, we evaluated a variety of approaches to each data set's analysis by having a group of independent expert analysts calculate their best density estimates without a priori knowledge of the true densities; this “blind” test allowed us to evaluate the influence of expertise and experience in calculating density estimates in comparison to simply using default values in programs {CAPTURE} and {DISTANCE}. While the rodent sample sizes were considerably smaller than the recommended minimum for good model results, we found that several models performed well empirically, including the web-based uniform and half-normal models in program {DISTANCE}, and the grid-based models Mb and Mbh in program {CAPTURE} (with {AÌ}‚ adjusted by species-specific full mean maximum distance moved ({MMDM}) values). These models produced accurate {DÌ}‚ values (with 95\% confidence intervals that included the true D values) and exhibited acceptable bias but poor precision. However, in linear regression analyses comparing each model's {DÌ}‚ values to the true D values over the range of observed test densities, only the web-based uniform model exhibited a regression slope near 1.0; all other models showed substantial slope deviations, indicating biased estimates at higher or lower density values. In addition, the grid-based {DÌ}‚ analyses using full {MMDM} values for {WÌ}‚ area adjustments required a number of theoretical assumptions of uncertain validity, and we therefore viewed their empirical successes with caution. Finally, density estimates from the independent analysts were highly variable, but estimates from web-based approaches had smaller mean square errors and better achieved confidence-interval coverage of D than did grid-based approaches. Our results support the contention that web-based approaches for density estimation of small-mammal populations are both theoretically and empirically superior to grid-based approaches, even when sample size is far less than often recommended. In view of the increasing need for standardized environmental measures for comparisons among ecosystems and through time, analytical models based on distance sampling appear to offer accurate density estimation approaches for research studies involving small-mammal abundances.

	abstract = {Statistical models for social networks have enabled researchers to study complex social phenomena that give rise to observed patterns of relationships among social actors and to gain a rich understanding of the interdependent nature of social ties and actors. Much of this research has focused on social networks within medium to large social groups. To date, these advances in statistical models for social networks, and in particular, of Exponential-Family Random Graph Models ({ERGMS}), have rarely been applied to the study of small networks, despite small network data in teams, families, and personal networks being common in many fields. In this paper, we revisit the estimation of {ERGMs} for small networks and propose using exhaustive enumeration when possible. We developed an R package that implements the estimation of pooled {ERGMs} for small networks using Maximum Likelihood Estimation ({MLE}), called “ergmito”. Based on the results of an extensive simulation study to assess the properties of the {MLE} estimator, we conclude that there are several benefits of direct {MLE} estimation compared to approximate methods and that this creates opportunities for valuable methodological innovations that can be applied to modeling social networks with {ERGMs}.},

Recently, social network analysis has provided an increasingly powerful and diverse toolset to enable animal behaviour researchers to quantify the social environment of animals and the impact that it has on ecological and evolutionary processes. However, there is considerable scope for improving these methods further. We outline an approach specifically designed to model the formation of network links, exponential random graph models ({ERGMs}), which have great potential for modelling animal social structure. {ERGMs} are generative models that treat network topology as a response variable. This makes them ideal for answering questions related directly to how and why social associations or interactions occur, from the modelling of population level transmission, through within-group behavioural dynamics to social evolutionary processes. We discuss how {ERGMs} have been used to study animal behaviour previously, and how recent developments in the {ERGM} framework can increase the scope of their use further. We also highlight the strengths and weaknesses of this approach relative to more conventional methods, and provide some guidance on the situations and research areas in which they can be used appropriately. {ERGMs} have the potential to be an important part of an animal behaviour researcher's toolkit and fully integrating them into the field should enhance our ability to understand what shapes animal social interactions, and identify the underlying processes that lead to the social structure of animal populations.},

Consequently, networks have been widely applied in infectious disease modeling. However most studies assume static network structure due to lack of accurate observation and appropriate analytic tools. In this study we used high temporal and spatial resolution animal position data to construct a high-resolution contact network relevant to infectious disease transmission. The animal contact network aggregated at hourly level was highly variable and dynamic within and between days, for both network structure (network degree distribution) and individual rank of degree distribution in the network (degree order). We integrated network degree distribution and degree order heterogeneities with a commonly used contact-based, directly transmitted disease model to quantify the effect of these two sources of heterogeneity on the infectious disease dynamics. Four conditions were simulated based on the combination of these two heterogeneities. Simulation results indicated that disease dynamics and individual contribution to new infections varied substantially among these four conditions under both parameter settings. Changes in the contact network had a greater effect on disease dynamics for pathogens with smaller basic reproduction number (i.e. R0 {\textless} 2).},

These effects may be especially relevant to pathogen‐host interactions. A detailed understanding of how and when spatial structure will affect the evolution of pathogen traits is likely to aid our ability to control rapidly emerging infectious diseases. Here we review a growing body of theoretical studies suggesting that spatial structure can lead to the evolution of an intermediate pathogen transmission rate and virulence. We explain the results of these studies in terms of a competition‐persistence trade‐off. These studies strongly suggest that local host interactions, local host dispersal, and relatively low host reproduction rates create a host population spatial structure that enforces this trade‐off and leads to the evolution of lower pathogen transmission rates and virulence. They also suggest that when spatial structure exists, it can dominate over the shape of the transmission‐virulence trade‐off in determining pathogen traits. We also identify important areas of future research, including quantifying pathogen fitness in a spatial context in order to gain a more mechanistic understanding of the effects of spatial structure and observationally and experimentally testing theoretical predictions.},

Seasonal birth pulses are frequently observed in wildlife and are expected to impact infection dynamics, yet their effect on pathogen persistence and {CCS} have not been considered. To investigate this issue theoretically, we use stochastic epidemiological models to ask how host life-history traits and infection parameters interact to determine pathogen persistence within a closed population. We fit seasonal birth pulse models to data from diverse mammalian species in order to identify realistic parameter ranges. When varying the synchrony of the birth pulse with all other parameters being constant, our model predicted that the {CCS} can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Tighter birth pulses tended to drive pathogen extinction by creating large amplitude oscillations in prevalence, especially with high demographic turnover and short infectious periods. Parameters affecting the relative timing of the epidemic and birth pulse peaks determined the intensity and direction of the effect of pre-existing immunity in the population on the pathogen's ability to persist beyond the initial epidemic following its introduction.},

Using a non-toxic biomarker, Rhodamine B ({RB}), we investigated the distances over which rodents are active around such potential introduction sites. Animals feeding at such sites were traced up to 100 m distant within a period of 10 days. We found that {RB} is a practical alternative for studying rodent movements.

We also found clades within Ekpoma, a relatively large cosmopolitan town in Edo state, that extended into other localities within Edo (2g-alpha) and Ondo (2g-delta). {LASV} variants from M. natalensis within Ebudin and Ekpoma in Edo State (dated approximately 1961) were more ancient compared to those from Ondo state (approximately 1977), suggesting a broadly east-west virus migration across south-western Nigeria; a pattern not always consistent with {LASV} sequences derived from humans in the same localities. Additionally, in Ebudin and Ekpoma, {LASV} sequences between M. natalensis and M. erythroleucus were interspersed on the phylogenetic tree, but those from M. erythroleucus were estimated to emerge more recently (approximately 2005). Overall, our results show that {LASV} amplification in certain localities (reaching a prevalence as high as 76\% in Okeluse), anthropogenically-aided spread of rodent-borne variants amidst the larger towns (involving communal accommodation such as student hostels), and virus-exchange between syntopic M. natalensis and M. erythroleucus rodents (as the latter, a savanna species, encroaches southward into the degraded forest) pose perpetual zoonotic hazard across the Edo-Ondo Lassa fever belt, threatening to accelerate the dissemination of the virus into non endemic areas.},

	abstract = {In this era of unprecedented biodiversity loss and increased zoonotic disease emergence, it is imperative to understand the effects of biodiversity on zoonotic pathogen dynamics in wildlife. Whether increasing biodiversity should lead to a decrease or increase in infection prevalence, termed the dilution and amplification effects, respectively, has been hotly debated in disease ecology. Sin Nombre hantavirus, which has an 
∼
∼
35\% mortality rate when it spills over into humans, occurs at a lower prevalence in the reservoir host, the North American deermouse, in areas with higher small mammal diversity—a dilution effect. However, the mechanism driving this relationship is not understood. Using a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics and a unique long-term, high-resolution, multisite dataset, it appears that the observed dilution effect is a result of increasing small-mammal diversity leading to decreased deermouse population density and, subsequently, prevalence (a result of density-dependent transmission). However, once density is taken into account, there is an increase in the transmission rate at sites with higher diversity—a component amplification effect. Therefore, dilution and amplification are occurring at the same time in the same host–pathogen system; there is a component amplification effect (increase in transmission rate), but overall a net dilution because the effect of diversity on reservoir host population density is stronger. These results suggest we should focus on how biodiversity affects individual mechanisms that drive prevalence and their relative strengths if we want to make generalizable predictions across host–pathogen systems.},

	abstract = {Human factors, including contact structure, movement, impact on the environment and patterns of behaviour, can have significant influence on the emergence of novel infectious diseases and the transmission and amplification of established ones. As anthropogenic climate change alters natural systems and global economic forces drive land-use and land-cover change, it becomes increasingly important to understand both the ecological and social factors that impact infectious disease outcomes for human populations. While the field of disease ecology explicitly studies the ecological aspects of infectious disease transmission, the effects of the social context on zoonotic pathogen spillover and subsequent human-to-human transmission are comparatively neglected in the literature. The social sciences encompass a variety of disciplines and frameworks for understanding infectious diseases; however, here we focus on four primary areas of social systems that quantitatively and qualitatively contribute to infectious diseases as social–ecological systems. These areas are social mixing and structure, space and mobility, geography and environmental impact, and behaviour and behaviour change. Incorporation of these social factors requires empirical studies for parametrization, phenomena characterization and integrated theoretical modelling of social–ecological interactions. The social–ecological system that dictates infectious disease dynamics is a complex system rich in interacting variables with dynamically significant heterogeneous properties. Future discussions about infectious disease spillover and transmission in human populations need to address the social context that affects particular disease systems by identifying and measuring qualitatively important drivers.

	abstract = {Aggregated species occurrence and abundance data from disparate sources are increasingly accessible to ecologists for the analysis of temporal trends in biodiversity. However, sampling biases relevant to any given research question are often poorly explored and infrequently reported; this can undermine statistical inference. In other disciplines, it is common for researchers to complete ‘risk-of-bias’ assessments to expose and document the potential for biases to undermine conclusions. The huge growth in available data, and recent controversies surrounding their use to infer temporal trends, indicate that similar assessments are urgently needed in ecology. We introduce {ROBITT}, a structured tool for assessing the ‘Risk-Of-Bias In studies of Temporal Trends in ecology’. {ROBITT} has a similar format to its counterparts in other disciplines: it comprises signalling questions designed to elicit information on the potential for bias in key study domains. In answering these, users will define study inferential goal(s) and relevant statistical target populations. This information is used to assess potential sampling biases across domains relevant to the research question (e.g. geography, taxonomy, environment), and how these vary through time. If assessments indicate biases, then users must clearly describe them and/or explain what mitigating action will be taken. Everything that users need to complete a {ROBITT} assessment is provided: the tool, a guidance document and a worked example. Following other disciplines, the tool and guidance document were developed through a consensus-forming process across experts working in relevant areas of ecology and evidence synthesis. We propose that researchers should be strongly encouraged to include a {ROBITT} assessment when publishing studies of biodiversity trends, especially when using aggregated data. This will help researchers to structure their thinking, clearly acknowledge potential sampling issues, highlight where expert consultation is required and provide an opportunity to describe data checks that might go unreported. {ROBITT} will also enable reviewers, editors and readers to establish how well research conclusions are supported given a dataset combined with some analytical approach. In turn, it should strengthen evidence-based policy and practice, reduce differing interpretations of data and provide a clearer picture of the uncertainties associated with our understanding of reality.},

	abstract = {Objective To assess the methodological quality of studies on prediction models developed using machine learning techniques across all medical specialties.
Design Systematic review.
Data sources {PubMed} from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019.
Eligibility criteria Articles reporting on the development, with or without external validation, of a multivariable prediction model (diagnostic or prognostic) developed using supervised machine learning for individualised predictions. No restrictions applied for study design, data source, or predicted patient related health outcomes.
Review methods Methodological quality of the studies was determined and risk of bias evaluated using the prediction risk of bias assessment tool ({PROBAST}). This tool contains 21 signalling questions tailored to identify potential biases in four domains. Risk of bias was measured for each domain (participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis) and each study (overall).
Results 152 studies were included: 58 (38\%) included a diagnostic prediction model and 94 (62\%) a prognostic prediction model. {PROBAST} was applied to 152 developed models and 19 external validations. Of these 171 analyses, 148 (87\%, 95\% confidence interval 81\% to 91\%) were rated at high risk of bias. The analysis domain was most frequently rated at high risk of bias. Of the 152 models, 85 (56\%, 48\% to 64\%) were developed with an inadequate number of events per candidate predictor, 62 handled missing data inadequately (41\%, 33\% to 49\%), and 59 assessed overfitting improperly (39\%, 31\% to 47\%). Most models used appropriate data sources to develop (73\%, 66\% to 79\%) and externally validate the machine learning based prediction models (74\%, 51\% to 88\%). Information about blinding of outcome and blinding of predictors was, however, absent in 60 (40\%, 32\% to 47\%) and 79 (52\%, 44\% to 60\%) of the developed models, respectively.
Conclusion Most studies on machine learning based prediction models show poor methodological quality and are at high risk of bias. Factors contributing to risk of bias include small study size, poor handling of missing data, and failure to deal with overfitting. Efforts to improve the design, conduct, reporting, and validation of such studies are necessary to boost the application of machine learning based prediction models in clinical practice.

	abstract = {Animal social networks are descriptions of social structure which, aside from their intrinsic interest for understanding sociality, can have significant bearing across many fields of biology. Network analysis provides a flexible toolbox for testing a broad range of hypotheses, and for describing the social system of species or populations in a quantitative and comparable manner. However, it requires careful consideration of underlying assumptions, in particular differentiating real from observed networks and controlling for inherent biases that are common in social data. We provide a practical guide for using this framework to analyse animal social systems and test hypotheses. First, we discuss key considerations when defining nodes and edges, and when designing methods for collecting data. We discuss different approaches for inferring social networks from these data and displaying them. We then provide an overview of methods for quantifying properties of nodes and networks, as well as for testing hypotheses concerning network structure and network processes. Finally, we provide information about assessing the power and accuracy of an observed network. Alongside this manuscript, we provide appendices containing background information on common programming routines and worked examples of how to perform network analysis using the r programming language. We conclude by discussing some of the major current challenges in social network analysis and interesting future directions. In particular, we highlight the under-exploited potential of experimental manipulations on social networks to address research questions.},

	abstract = {Networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a ‘mixing network’. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks—and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm—have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures., Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control.},

They fed more on seeds, arthropods and grasses during the wet season and on the other plant materials during the dry season. Maize seed was the most preferred diet category, when available. The shifts towards greater consumption of maize, when available, coupled by the high densities attained by this species render it the greatest potential rodent pest in the study areas.},

The aim was to investigate the influence of diet on breeding patterns of M. natalensis. Removal trapping was used to capture rodents and analyse diet categories while Capture-mark-release trapping was used to investigate breeding patterns of female M. natalensis. Mastomys natalensis comprised 94\% of the total capture, and the remaining 6\% comprised of six other species. Statistical analysis of food preferences indicated that both vegetative materials and seeds were significantly higher in the overall diet of M. natalensis compared with other food materials. Significant differences in the proportions of vegetative materials and seeds were found between seasons (dry, wet), but not between habitats (fallow, maize). There was a clear seasonal pattern in the proportion of reproductively active females with peaks in April and troughs in October. The proportion of vegetative materials was highest during the wet season and correlated positively with reproductive activity, suggesting that vegetative materials contain certain compounds (e.g. 6-{MBOA}) that trigger reproductive activity in M. natalensis. The breeding activity of M. natalensis in semi-arid areas might, thus, be reduced by limiting access to fresh vegetative food (e.g. young sprouting grass).},

	abstract = {We investigated the composition of the diet of the multi-mammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, within irrigated rice and fallow field habitats at set time periods related to rice crop growth stages. In both habitats, vegetative plant material, i.e. leaves, stems and seeds, were the most abundant components of the rodent's diet, while other food types (invertebrates, fruits) were observed only in low quantities. We conclude that vegetative plant material and seeds were the main types of food consumed not only due to their relatively higher abundance in the environments under study but also because of the highly specialised herbivorous/granivorous nature of the dominant rodent species, M. natalensis. Thus, the introduction and expansion of continuous rice-cropping using irrigation in Tanzania is likely to be severely constrained by the presence of M. natalensis. In our opinion, field hygiene, including the removal of alternative food resources and nesting sites for M. natalensis near cropping areas, may help to both lower rodent population numbers and reduce immigration potential. Non-chemical rodent control methods such as trap barrier systems developed for lowland irrigated rice in south-eastern Asia should, we argue, be evaluated for their effectiveness under African conditions.},

Investigations were based on food choice tests in caged animals. Among the cereals tested, rice was significantly preferred (P=0.01) followed by wheat, sorghum and maize. Of the additives tested, both sexes of M. natalensis significantly preferred baits containing either 1,3 and 5\% sucrose (p=0.05), or 3 and 5\% glycerine, or 3\% fish, or 1\% sucrose. Also both sexes rejected bait containing 1 and 3\% molasses. Additives such as 1\% glycerine, 1 and 3\% groundnut did not significantly influence bait intake. Sex preference differential was observed on baits containing 1 and 5\% fish, 1 and 5\% groundnut, 5\% cotton oil, 5\% cod liver oil and 0.5\% salt.

	abstract = {Background Increasingly, vaccine efficacy studies are being recommended in low-and-middle-income countries ({LMIC}), yet often facilities are unavailable to take and store infant blood samples correctly. Dried blood spots ({DBS}), are useful for collecting blood from infants for diagnostic purposes, especially in low-income settings, as the amount of blood required is miniscule and no refrigeration is required. Little is known about their utility for antibody studies in children. This systematic review aims to investigate the correlation of antibody concentrations against infectious diseases in {DBS} in comparison to serum or plasma samples that might inform their use in vaccine clinical trials. Methods and findings We searched {MEDLINE}, Embase and the Cochrane library for relevant studies between January 1990 to October 2020 with no language restriction, using {PRISMA} guidelines, investigating the correlation between antibody concentrations in {DBS} and serum or plasma samples, and the effect of storage temperature on {DBS} diagnostic performance. We included 40 studies in this systematic review. The antibody concentration in {DBS} and serum/plasma samples reported a good pooled correlation, (r2 = 0.86 (ranged 0.43 to 1.00)). Ten studies described a decline of antibody after 28 days at room temperature compared to optimal storage at -20°C, where antibodies were stable for up to 200 days. There were only five studies of anti-bacterial antibodies. Conclusions There is a good correlation between antibody concentrations in {DBS} and serum/plasma samples, supporting the wider use of {DBS} in vaccine and sero-epidemiological studies, but there is limited data on anti-bacterial antibodies. The correct storage of {DBS} is critical and may be a consideration for longer term storage.},

Problems in evolutionary ecology, macroecology, and biogeography are illuminated by this integrative view. The book focuses on correlative approaches known as ecological niche modeling, species distribution modeling, or habitat suitability modeling, which use associations between known occurrences of species and environmental variables to identify environmental conditions under which populations can be maintained. The spatial distribution of environments suitable for the species can then be estimated: a potential distribution for the species. This approach has broad applicability to ecology, evolution, biogeography, and conservation biology, as well as to understanding the geographic potential of invasive species and infectious diseases, and the biological implications of climate change. The authors lay out conceptual foundations and general principles for understanding and interpreting species distributions with respect to geography and environment. Focus is on development of niche models. While serving as a guide for students and researchers, the book also provides a theoretical framework to support future progress in the field.},

Our goal was to create a new small mammal trapping protocol that improved detection of rare species, such as the olive-backed pocket mouse (Perognathus fasciatus). We used three trap and bait types and trapped an area 4.4 times larger than the standard grid. We also assessed the effect of captures of non-target species on detection probability of pocket mice. Regardless of species, trap success was higher for Havaharts. We found that bait and trap type selection varied significantly by species, with pocket mice showing strongest selection for Havahart traps baited with bird seed. Increasing grid size, while maintaining a similar trapping effort, resulted in higher detection probability, although our analyses showed that effective grids can be about three-quarters of the size we use to achieve similar results. We were also able to demonstrate that by deploying a combination of different traps and baits it is possible to overcome the potential effect of non-target species (e.g., deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus) on the detection probability of pocket mice. Our results show that simple changes to standard small-mammal trapping methods can dramatically increase the detectability of rare and elusive small mammals. Increasing detection probability of rare components of a community can improve the results and understanding of future studies.},

Sherman Inc., Tallahassee, Flor.) and Longworth (Penlon Ltd., Oxford, U.K.) live traps in small-mammal-community assessment, few studies have directly compared the effectiveness of these 2 popular models. This study compared the relative efficacy of both trap types in capturing small mammals in southern Wisconsin grasslands. As trap size may cause capture bias, we compared Longworth traps with equal numbers of small and large, folding Sherman traps. We also deployed a small number of pitfalls. We carried out trapping at 12 sites over a 2-year period (1996–1997). We observed a significant year effect, so we analyzed differences in capture success, species diversity indices, and percent community similarity between trap types separately for each year. Two-way contingency table analyses indicated that all 3 trap types exhibited species-specific differences in capture rates. We assessed standardized deviates for each cell within this two-way design, and we considered departures greater than 2 standard deviations ({SE}±1.96) from the mean to show an either significantly positive (≥ + 1.96) or significantly negative (≤ −1.96) association. In the first year, Longworth traps captured greater numbers of long-tailed shrews (Sorex spp.) whereas small Sherman traps captured more western harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis) and white-footed or prairie deer mice (Peromyscus spp.). In the second year, small Sherman captures were greater for long-tailed shrews and western harvest mice while large Sherman traps captured more meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and jumping mice (Zapus hudsonius). Although estimates of community diversity were similar between trap types, percent community similarity estimates were lowest for Longworth-Sherman trap comparisons. Mortality rates were highest for Longworth traps and small Sherman traps and lowest for large Sherman traps. Pitfalls caught proportionally more long-tailed shrews than conventional live traps in the first but not the second year of study. In general, body mass of the animal had little effect on trap capture rates. However, in the first year of this study, small Sherman traps caught lighter (P =0.028) long-tailed shrews than the large Sherman traps. Similarly, Longworth traps caught significantly lighter white-footed/prairie deer mice than either small (P=0.022) or large (P= 0.035) Shermans. When used in combination, both Longworth and Sherman traps can diminish overall sampling error and yield less biased estimates of species composition than either trap type alone. The use of new as opposed to used Sherman traps in the second year of this study might account for the greater capture efficacy of these traps and contribute to differences in relative trap type success between years.},

	abstract = {Aim Presence-only datasets represent an important source of information on species' distributions. Collections of presence-only data, however, are often spatially biased, particularly along roads and near urban populations. These biases can lead to inaccurate inferences and predicted distributions. We demonstrate a new approach of accounting for effort bias in presence-only data by explicitly incorporating sample biases in species distribution modelling. Location Alberta, Canada. Methods First, we used logistic regression to model sampling effort of recorded rare vascular plants, bryophytes and butterflies in Alberta. Second, we simulated presence/absence data for nine ‘virtual’ species based on three relative occurrence thresholds – common, rare and very rare – for each taxonomic group. We sampled these virtual species using our bias model to represent typical sampling effort characteristic of presence-only datasets. We then modelled the distributions of these virtual species using logistic regression and attempted to recover their original simulated distributions using a sample weighting term (prior weight) estimated as the inverse of probability of sampling. Bias-adjusted model estimates were compared to those obtained from random samples and biased samples without adjustment. We also compared prior-weight adjustment to bias-file and target-group background approaches in Maxent. Results Sample weighting recovered regression coefficients and mapped predictions estimated from unbiased presence-only data and improved model predictive accuracy as evaluated by regression and correlation coefficients, sensitivity and specificity. Similar model improvements were achieved using the Maxent bias-file method, but results were inconsistent for the target-group background approach. Main conclusions These results suggest that sample weighting can be used to account for spatially biased presence-only datasets in species distribution modelling. The framework presented is potentially widely applicable due to availability of online biodiversity databases and the flexibility of the approach.},

	abstract = {This study used four near-real-time multispectral Systeme pour l'Observation de la Terre ({SPOT}) high-resolution visible ({HRV} ) images to establish land cover and forest classes of relevance to slash-and-burn agriculture. The study was conducted in 1.43 million ha of the Alternative to Slash-and-Burn ({ASB}) global benchmark research area for Africa selected as representative of the entire Congolese basin of Central Africa and located in Southern Cameroon. The land cover and forest classes mapped have different impacts on global phenomena as well as their own management challenges and include slash-and-burn dominant farmlands, C hromolenea orodata dominant short-fallows, Imperata cylindrica dominant weeds, long-fallows or regenerated forests, raphia palm-dominant lowlands, permanently flooded swamp forests, and primary and secondary forests. In order to map these distinct and complex classes the study proposes and implements a piecemeal approach to classification involving stratification of the image into several distinct discrete subsets of forest corridors, lowlands, and uplands. The approach involves the use of image texture indicators in conjunction with groundtruth data to divide the image into discrete subsets, performing unsupervised classification on these discrete subsets, masking problem classes and reclassifying them, editing certain spectrally inseparable areas, adopting post-classification strategies, and finally mosaicking the discrete subsets into one seamless image. This approach led to an overall mapping accuracy of 82.4\% with individual classes mapped at accuracies above 72.9\% (user's), and above 66.7\% (producer's).},

The rainforest in Ghana has experienced rapid depletion since the 1980s. The impact of deforestation is widespread, affecting the livelihoods of local people and disrupting the tropical ecosystem. There is a serious concern in the study area about climatic change, soil erosion, siltation of rivers and loss in biodiversity which have an adverse impact on traditional medicinal plants of the local people. The study examined the extent of land cover change through image differencing of Landsat {TM} 1986 and 2002. The image classification indicated that, vegetative cover from 1986 to 2002 has been reducing whiles land use activities have been increasing. Closed canopy, open canopy and plantation have significantly diminished and land use activities especially built ups, farms, mining and openfields are more than doubled. The driving forces for the change in land cover are population growth, lumbering, socio-economic and cultural practices of the people. Lumbering and mining have been some of the major causes of the changing landscape in primary forest. Also the reliance on wood for domestic energy and the need to increase food productivity to feed growing population have also contributed greatly to the rapid depletion of the vegetative cover.},

	abstract = {Banana (and plantain, Musa spp.), in sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}), is predominantly grown as a mixed crop by smallholder farmers in backyards and small farmlands, typically ranging from 0.2 ha to 3 ha. The crop is affected by several pests and diseases, including the invasive banana bunchy top virus ({BBTV}, genus Babuvirus), which is emerging as a major threat to banana production in {SSA}. The {BBTV} outbreak in West Africa was first recorded in the Benin Republic in 2010 and has spread to the adjoining territories of Nigeria and Togo. Regular surveillance, conducted as part of the containment efforts, requires the identification of banana fields for disease assessment. However, small and fragmented production spread across large areas poses complications for identifying all banana farms using conventional field survey methods, which is also time-consuming and expensive. In this study, we developed a remote sensing approach and machine learning ({ML}) models that can be used to identify banana fields for targeted {BBTV} surveillance. We used medium-resolution synthetic aperture radar ({SAR}), Sentinel 2A satellite imagery, and high-resolution {RGB} and multispectral aerial imagery from an unmanned aerial vehicle ({UAV}) to develop an operational banana mapping framework by combining the {UAV}, {SAR}, and Sentinel 2A data with the Support Vector Machine ({SVM}) and Random Forest ({RF}) machine learning algorithms. The {ML} algorithms performed comparatively well in classifying the land cover, with a mean overall accuracy ({OA}) of about 93\% and a Kappa coefficient ({KC}) of 0.89 for the {UAV} data. The model using fused {SAR} and Sentinel 2A data gave an {OA} of 90\% and {KC} of 0.86. The user accuracy ({UA}) and producer accuracy ({PA}) for the banana class were 83\% and 78\%, respectively. The {BBTV} surveillance teams used the banana mapping framework to identify banana fields in the {BBTV}-affected southwest Ogun state of Nigeria, which helped in detecting 17 sites with {BBTV} infection. These findings suggest that the prediction of banana and other crops in the heterogeneous smallholder farming systems is feasible, with the precision necessary to guide {BBTV} surveillance in large areas in {SSA}.},

Relations between Sherbros and migrants are grounded in the use of the host–stranger sociocultural idiom, which regulates social obligations between groups and implies the incorporation of migrants into local communities through Poro initiation. As migrants increasingly refuse initiation, the place of Poro in the political and cultural domains is being renegotiated. The chapter demonstrates that while the Poro society becomes progressively disconnected from local politics, it takes on renewed importance within the religious and cultural spheres.},

            Lassa fever ({LF}) is a potentially lethal viral haemorrhagic infection of humans caused by
            Lassa mammarenavirus
            ({LASV}). It is an important endemic zoonotic disease in West Africa with growing evidence for increasing frequency and sizes of outbreaks. Phylogeographic and molecular epidemiology methods have projected expansion of the Lassa fever endemic zone in the context of future global change. The Natal multimammate mouse (
            Mastomys natalensis
            ) is the predominant {LASV} reservoir, with few studies investigating the role of other animal species. To explore host sequencing biases, all {LASV} nucleotide sequences and associated metadata available on {GenBank} (n = 2,298) were retrieved. Most data originated from Nigeria (54\%), Guinea (20\%) and Sierra Leone (14\%). Data from non-human hosts (n = 703) were limited and only 69 sequences encompassed complete genes. We found a strong positive correlation between the number of confirmed human cases and sequences at the country level (
            r
            = 0.93 (95\% Confidence Interval = 0.71 - 0.98),
            p
            {\textless} 0.001) but no correlation exists between confirmed cases and the number of available rodent sequences (
            r
            = -0.019 (95\% C.I. -0.71 - 0.69),
            p =
            0.96). Spatial modelling of sequencing effort highlighted current biases in locations of available sequences, with increased effort observed in Southern Guinea and Southern Nigeria. Phylogenetic analyses showed geographic clustering of {LASV} lineages, suggestive of isolated events of human-to-rodent transmission and the emergence of currently circulating strains of {LASV} from the year 1498 in Nigeria. Overall, the current study highlights significant geographic limitations in {LASV} surveillance, particularly, in non-human hosts. Further investigation of the non-human reservoir of {LASV}, alongside expanded surveillance, are required for precise characterisation of the emergence and dispersal of {LASV}. Accurate surveillance of {LASV} circulation in non-human hosts is vital to guide early detection and initiation of public health interventions for future Lassa fever outbreaks.},

	abstract = {The emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) causes lethal respiratory infections mainly on the Arabian Peninsula. The evolutionary origins of {MERS}-{CoV} are unknown. We determined the full genome sequence of a {CoV} directly from fecal material obtained from a South African Neoromicia capensis bat ({NeoCoV}). {NeoCoV} shared essential details of genome architecture with {MERS}-{CoV}. Eighty-five percent of the {NeoCoV} genome was identical to {MERS}-{CoV} at the nucleotide level. Based on taxonomic criteria, {NeoCoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} belonged to one viral species. The presence of a genetically divergent S1 subunit within the {NeoCoV} spike gene indicated that intraspike recombination events may have been involved in the emergence of {MERS}-{CoV}. {NeoCoV} constitutes a sister taxon of {MERS}-{CoV}, placing the {MERS}-{CoV} root between a recently described virus from African camels and all other viruses. This suggests a higher level of viral diversity in camels than in humans. Together with serologic evidence for widespread {MERS}-{CoV} infection in camelids sampled up to 20 years ago in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, the genetic data indicate that camels act as sources of virus for humans rather than vice versa. The majority of camels on the Arabian Peninsula is imported from the Greater Horn of Africa, where several Neoromicia species occur. The acquisition of {MERS}-{CoV} by camels from bats might have taken place in sub-Saharan Africa. Camelids may represent mixing vessels for {MERS}-{CoV} and other mammalian {CoVs}.
{IMPORTANCE} It is unclear how, when, and where the highly pathogenic {MERS}-{CoV} emerged. We characterized the full genome of an African bat virus closely related to {MERS}-{CoV} and show that human, camel, and bat viruses belong to the same viral species. The bat virus roots the phylogenetic tree of {MERS}-{CoV}, providing evidence for an evolution of {MERS}-{CoV} in camels that preceded that in humans. The revised tree suggests that humans are infected by camels rather than vice versa. Although {MERS}-{CoV} cases occur mainly on the Arabian Peninsula, the data from this study together with serologic and molecular investigations of African camels indicate that the initial host switch from bats may have taken place in Africa. The emergence of {MERS}-{CoV} likely involved exchanges of genetic elements between different viral ancestors. These exchanges may have taken place either in bat ancestors or in camels acting as mixing vessels for viruses from different hosts.},

Zoonotic pathogens may be bacterial, viral or parasitic, or may involve unconventional agents and can spread to humans through direct contact or through food, water or the environment. They represent a major public health problem around the world due to our close relationship with animals in agriculture, as companions and in the natural environment. Zoonoses can also cause disruptions in the production and trade of animal products for food and other uses. 

Zoonoses comprise a large percentage of all newly identified infectious diseases as well as many existing ones. Some diseases, such as {HIV}, begin as a zoonosis but later mutate into human-only strains. Other zoonoses can cause recurring disease outbreaks, such as Ebola virus disease and salmonellosis. Still others, such as the novel coronavirus that causes {COVID}-19, have the potential to cause global pandemics.},

	abstract = {Stochastic processes play an important role in the infectious disease dynamics of wildlife, especially in species subject to large population oscillations. Here, we study the case of a free ranging population of yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) in northern Italy, where circulation of Dobrava-Belgrade hantavirus ({DOBV}) has been detected intermittently since 2001, until an outbreak emerged in 2010. We analysed the transmission dynamics of the recent outbreak using a computational model that accounts for seasonal changes of the host population and territorial behaviour. Model parameters were informed by capture-mark-recapture data collected over 14 years and longitudinal seroprevalence data from 2010 to 2013. The intermittent observation of {DOBV} before 2010 can be interpreted as repeated stochastic fadeouts after multiple introductions of infectious rodents migrating from neighbouring areas. We estimated that only 20\% of introductions in a naïve host population results in sustained transmission after 2 years, despite an effective reproduction number well above the epidemic threshold (mean 4·5, 95\% credible intervals, {CI}: 0·65–15·8). Following the 2010 outbreak, {DOBV} has become endemic in the study area, but we predict a constant probability of about 4·7\% per year that infection dies out, following large population drops in winter. In the absence of stochastic fadeout, viral prevalence is predicted to continue its growth to an oscillating equilibrium around a value of 24\% (95\% {CI}: 3–57). We presented an example of invasion dynamics of a zoonotic virus where stochastic fadeout have played a major role and may induce future extinction of the endemic infection.},

	abstract = {Most human infectious diseases, especially recently emerging pathogens, originate from animals and ongoing disease transmission from animals to people presents a significant global health burden. Recognition of the epidemiologic circumstances involved in zoonotic spillover, amplification and spread of diseases is essential for prioritizing surveillance and predicting future disease emergence risk. We examine the animal hosts and transmission mechanisms involved in spillover of zoonotic viruses to date and discover that viruses with high host plasticity (i.e. taxonomically and ecologically diverse host range) were more likely to amplify viral spillover by secondary human-to-human transmission and have broader geographic spread. Viruses transmitted to humans during practices that facilitate mixing of diverse animal species had significantly higher host plasticity. Our findings suggest that animal-to-human spillover of new viruses that are capable of infecting diverse host species signal emerging disease events with higher pandemic potential in that these viruses are more likely to amplify by human-to-human transmission with spread on a global scale.},

Rodents, especially, Mystomys natalensis, are the known reservoirs of {LASV} and humans are the defined hosts. Monkeys share many illnesses with humans and experimental {LASV} infections in monkeys are fatal but natural {LASV} infection of monkeys has not been reported. Serum samples obtained between August 2015 and December 2017 from 62 monkeys belonging to six species in Southern Nigeria were tested for {LASV} as part of an ongoing surveillance of monkeys in the region for zoonotic pathogens. Commercially available Recombinant {LASV} ({ReLASV}) Pan-Lassa enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ({ELISA}) test kits (Zalgen Labs, Germantown, {MD}, {USA}) were used to detect antibodies ({IgG} and {IgM}) and antigen specific for {LASV} nucleoprotein in the sera. Lassa-fever-specific {IgG} and {IgM}, and antigen specific for {LASV} nucleoprotein were detected in 5/62, 0/62, and 1/62 samples, respectively. The presence of {LASV}-specific antibodies in the sera suggests natural exposure to the virus, while the presence of {LASV} antigen may mean that monkeys are carriers of the virus. There is a need to broaden Lassa fever surveillance to include nonhuman primates ({NHPs}) for their probable role in the epidemiology of the disease., {HIGHLIGHTS}

	abstract = {Most viral infections are limited by nonspecific defenses, which (1) restrict initial virus multiplication to manageable levels, (2) initiate recovery from established infections that is then completed by a combination of these early nonspecific and subsequent antigen-specific immune defenses, and (3) enable the host to cope with the peak numbers of virus that, if presented as the infecting dose, could be lethal. Although immune and nonimmune (nonspecific) defenses operate together to control viral infections, this chapter considers only nonspecific defenses. Some nonspecific defenses exist independently of infection (e.g., genetic factors, anatomic barriers, nonspecific inhibitors in body fluids, and phagocytosis). Others (e.g., fever, inflammation, and interferon) are produced by the host in response to infection. All nonspecific defenses begin to act before the specific defense responses develop and can potentiate some of the established immune effector mechanisms. The fact that viruses replicate intracellularly and the ability of some viruses to spread by inducing cell fusion partly protect viruses against such extracellular defenses as neutralizing antibody, phagocytosis, and nonspecific inhibitors. However, because they replicate within the cell, viruses are vulnerable to intracellular alterations caused by host responses to infection. Nonspecific responses that alter the intracellular environment include fever, inflammation, and interferon. These multiple defenses function with great complexity because of their interactions with one another. This complexity is compounded by the varying effectiveness of the defenses that results from the diversity of viruses, hosts, and sites and stages of infection.},

Aerosol stability and respiratory infectivity of the Josiah strain of Lassa virus were assessed to determine the effect of environmental factors on aerosol-induced infection. The stability of the virus in aerosol, particularly at low relative humidity (30\% {RH}), plus the ability of the virus to infect guinea pigs and monkeys via the respiratory route emphasize the potential for aerosol transmission of Lassa virus. Biological half-lives at both 24 and 32 degrees C ranged from 10.1 to 54.6 min, and were sufficient for aerosol dispersion of virus to considerable distances in natural situations. Infectivity of Lassa virus in small particle aerosol was demonstrated in outbred guinea pigs and cynomolgus monkeys using dynamic aerosol equipment. Monkeys exposed to inhaled doses to 465 {PFU} were infected and died. The median infectious dose ({ID}50) for guinea pigs was 15 {PFU}, yet a definitive median lethal aerosol dose ({LD}50) could not be established.

Virus may spill over from the rodent cycle to man by various routes. Secondary spread between humans may occur within domiciliary groups, and persons infected within the community who develop clinical disease may introduce the virus into hospital and begin a cycle of nosocomial infection.Between 1969, when Lassa fever was first described, and June 1975, the disease was recognized on 9 discrete occasions, affecting 114 persons. Over one-third of these infections were acquired by person-to-person spread within hospitals. In only one outbreak (in Sierra Leone) were the majority of cases acquired in the community. Recent observations have indicated hyperendemic disease in eastern Sierra Leone. Cases have occurred in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, and serological evidence exists for activity of the virus elsewhere in West and Central Africa. Seasonal factors appear to play a role in the appearance of human cases. Attack rates have been higher in adults than in children. The source of infection and potential routes of virus transmission in the various epidemics are discussed, and perspectives for future epidemiological research are presented.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic disease endemic to west Africa. No large-scale studies exist from Nigeria, where the Lassa virus ({LASV}) is most diverse. {LASV} diversity, coupled with host genetic and environmental factors, might cause differences in disease pathophysiology. Small-scale studies in Nigeria suggest that acute kidney injury is an important clinical feature and might be a determinant of survival. We aimed to establish the demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors associated with mortality in Nigerian patients with Lassa fever, and hypothesised that {LASV} was the direct cause of intrinsic renal damage for a subset of the patients with Lassa fever.
{METHODS}: We did a retrospective, observational cohort study of consecutive patients in Nigeria with Lassa fever, who tested positive for {LASV} with {RT}-{PCR}, and were treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital. We did univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, including logistic regression, of all demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables available at presentation to identify the factors associated with patient mortality.
{FINDINGS}: Of 291 patients treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital between Jan 3, 2011, and Dec 11, 2015, 284 (98\%) had known outcomes (died or survived) and seven (2\%) were discharged against medical advice. Overall case-fatality rate was 24\% (68 of 284 patients), with a 1·4 times increase in mortality risk for each 10 years of age (p=0·00017), reaching 39\% (22 of 57) for patients older than 50 years. Of 284 patients, 81 (28\%) had acute kidney injury and 104 (37\%) had {CNS} manifestations and thus both were considered important complications of acute Lassa fever in Nigeria. Acute kidney injury was strongly associated with poor outcome (case-fatality rate of 60\% [49 of 81 patients]; odds ratio [{OR}] 15, p{\textless}0·00001). Compared with patients without acute kidney injury, those with acute kidney injury had higher incidence of proteinuria (32 [82\%] of 39 patients) and haematuria (29 [76\%] of 38) and higher mean serum potassium (4·63 [{SD} 1·04] mmol/L) and lower blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (8·6 for patients without clinical history of fluid loss), suggesting intrinsic renal damage. Normalisation of creatinine concentration was associated with recovery. Elevated serum creatinine ({OR} 1·3; p=0·046), aspartate aminotransferase ({OR} 1·5; p=0·075), and potassium ({OR} 3·6; p=0·0024) were independent predictors of death.
{INTERPRETATION}: Our study presents detailed clinical and laboratory data for Nigerian patients with Lassa fever and provides strong evidence for intrinsic renal dysfunction in acute Lassa fever. Early recognition and treatment of acute kidney injury might significantly reduce mortality.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Lassa virus ({LASV}), the causative agent of Lassa fever ({LF}), an endemic acute viral haemorrhagic illness in Nigeria, is transmitted by direct contact with the rodent, contaminated food or household items. Person-to-person transmission also occurs and sexual transmission has been reported. Thus, this study investigated the presence of {LASV} in body fluids of suspected and confirmed cases.
{METHODS}: this was a cross-sectional study between March 2018 and April 2019 involving 112 consenting suspected and post ribavirin confirmed cases attending the Lassa fever treatment center in Ondo State. Whole blood was collected from 57 suspected and 29 confirmed cases. Other samples from confirmed cases were 5 each of High Vaginal Swab ({HVS}) and seminal fluid; 12 breast milk and 4 urine. All samples were analyzed using reverse transcription-{PCR} ({RT}-{PCR}) targeting the S-gene of {LASV}.
{RESULTS}: analysis of whole blood by {RT}-{PCR} showed that 1/57 (1.8\%) suspected and 1/29 (3.4\%) confirmed post ribavirin treated cases were positive. While {LASV} was detected in 2/5 (40\%) post ribavirin treated seminal fluids and 1/11 (8.3\%) breast milk. However, {LASV} was not detected in any of the {HVS} and urine samples.
{CONCLUSION}: the detection of {LASV} in seminal fluid and breast milk of discharged post ribavirin treated cases suggests its persistence in these fluids of recovering Nigerians. The role of postnatal and sexual transmissions in the perennial outbreak of {LF} needs to be further evaluated.},

The most devastating arenavirus in terms of human disease is Lassa fever virus, causing up to 300,000 annual infections in West Africa. We used a model for Lassa fever in which Rhesus macaques were infected with a related virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ({LCMV}). Our goals were to determine the outcome of infection after mucosal inoculation and later lethal challenge, to characterize protective immune responses, and to test cross-protection between a virulent ({LCMV}-{WE}) and an avirulent ({LCMV}-{ARM}) strain of virus. Although intravenous infections in the monkey model were uniformly lethal, intragastric infections recapitulated the spectrum of clinical outcomes seen in human exposure to Lassa fever virus: death, recovery from disease, and most often, subclinical infection. Plaque neutralization, {ELISA}, lymphocyte proliferation, and chromium-release assays were used to monitor humoral and cellular immune responses. Cross protection between the two strains was observed. The three out of seven monkeys that experienced protection were also the three with the strongest cell-mediated immunity. J. Med.

	abstract = {This is the first study to compare health status and access to health care services between disabled and non-disabled men and women in urban and peri-urban areas of Sierra Leone. It pays particular attention to access to reproductive health care services and maternal health care for disabled women. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2009 in 5 districts of Sierra Leone, randomly selecting 17 clusters for a total sample of 425 households. All adults who were identified as being disabled, as well as a control group of randomly selected non-disabled adults, were interviewed about health and reproductive health. As expected, we showed that people with severe disabilities had less access to public health care services than non-disabled people after adjustment for other socioeconomic characteristics (bivariate modelling). However, there were no significant differences in reporting use of contraception between disabled and non-disabled people; contrary to expectations, women with disabilities were as likely to report access to maternal health care services as did non-disabled women. Rather than disability, it is socioeconomic inequality that governs access to such services. We also found that disabled women were as likely as non-disabled women to report having children and to desiring another child: they are not only sexually active, but also need access to reproductive health services. We conclude that disparity in access to government-supported health care facilities constitutes a major and persisting health inequity between persons with and without disabilities in Sierra Leone. Ensuring equal access will require further strengthening of the country’s health care system. Furthermore, because the morbidity and mortality rates of pregnant women are persistently high in Sierra Leone, assessing the quality of services received is an important priority for future research.},

	abstract = {Given that rodents are responsible for nearly 280 million cases of undernutrition worldwide and that about 400 million people are affected by rodent-associated zoonoses annually, management of rodent populations that are agricultural pests and/or reservoirs of pathogens is a major food security and public health matter. In sub-Saharan Africa, the median crop loss due to rodents is about 16\% in the field and around 8\% during storage. The impact on public health is not well-established, albeit over 60 zoonotic diseases can be spread to humans via rodents. Therefore, focusing on rodent-related community knowledge, attitudes, and practices is crucial to establishing robust baseline information as a springboard for future targeted studies. The study was conducted in September 2020 in Lilongwe and Nkhata Bay districts in Central and Northern Malawi, respectively. A semi-structured questionnaire, focus group discussions, and interviews with key informants were used. Farmers reported rodents were a major problem for staple crops (maize, rice, and cassava) and the main species responsible were the Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis), silver mole-rat (Heliophobius argenteocinereus), and house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus). Awareness of rodent-associated health risks is very low, as exemplified by reports of rodent–human bites, eating rodent-contaminated food, and processing and consumption of wild rodents in poor hygienic conditions, and these practices were flourishing when Malawi was a bubonic plague endemic country. Rodent management is less practiced, and when practiced, it is symptomatic. It is considered a matter of individual households and typically relies on the use of rodenticides and insecticides without proper dosage and user instructions. We recommend rigorous campaigns to create better awareness among the public regarding the impacts of rodents on agriculture and community health and the need for community engagement for effective rodent management. A paradigm shift is needed by adapting and adopting practices of ecologically-based rodent management and reducing dependence on synthetic chemical rodenticides.},

	abstract = {H1N1 ("swine flu"), {SARS}, mad cow disease, and {HIV}/{AIDS} are a few examples of zoonotic diseases-diseases transmitted between humans and animals. Zoonotic diseases are a growing concern given multiple factors: their often novel and unpredictable nature, their ability to emerge anywhere and spread rapidly around the globe, and their major economic toll on several disparate industries. Infectious disease surveillance systems are used to detect this threat to human and animal health. By systematically collecting data on the occurrence of infectious diseases in humans and animals, investigators can track the spread of disease and provide an early warning to human and animal health officials, nationally and internationally, for follow-up and response. Unfortunately, and for many reasons, current disease surveillance has been ineffective or untimely in alerting officials to emerging zoonotic diseases. Sustaining Global Surveillance and Response to Emerging Zoonotic Diseases assesses some of the disease surveillance systems around the world, and recommends ways to improve early detection and response. The book presents solutions for improved coordination between human and animal health sectors, and among governments and international organizations. Parties seeking to improve the detection and response to zoonotic diseases--including U.S. government and international health policy makers, researchers, epidemiologists, human health clinicians, and veterinarians--can use this book to help curtail the threat zoonotic diseases pose to economies, societies, and health.},

	abstract = {The Ebola virus disease epidemic that threatened West Africa between 2013 and 2016 was of unprecedented health magnitude. After this health crisis, studies highlighted the need to introduce community-based surveillance systems and to adopt a One Health approach. This study aimed to provide preparatory insights for the definition of a community-based surveillance system for emerging zoonoses such as viral hemorrhagic fevers in Guinea. The objective was to explore the disease detection capacity and the surveillance network opportunities at the community level in two pilot areas in the forest region of Guinea, where the epidemic emerged. Based on a participatory epidemiological and One Health approach, we conducted Focus Group Discussions with human, animal and ecosystem health actors. We used a range of participatory tools, included semi-structured interviews, ranking, scoring and flow diagram, to estimate the local knowledge and perception of diseases and clinical signs and to investigate the existing health information exchange network and its related strengths and weaknesses. The results showed that there is heterogeneity in knowledge of diseases and perception of the clinical signs among actors and that there are preferred and more effective health communication channels opportunities. This preparatory study suggests that it is necessary to adapt the case definitions and the health communication channels to the different actors who can play a role in a future community-based surveillance system and provides recommendations for future surveillance activities to be carried out in West Africa.},
