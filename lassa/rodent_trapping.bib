	abstract = {Land use change-for example, the conversion of natural habitats to agricultural or urban ecosystems-is widely recognized to influence the risk and emergence of zoonotic disease in humans1,2. However, whether such changes in risk are underpinned by predictable ecological changes remains unclear. It has been suggested that habitat disturbance might cause predictable changes in the local diversity and taxonomic composition of potential reservoir hosts, owing to systematic, trait-mediated differences in species resilience to human pressures3,4. Here we analyse 6,801 ecological assemblages and 376 host species worldwide, controlling for research effort, and show that land use has global and systematic effects on local zoonotic host communities. Known wildlife hosts of human-shared pathogens and parasites overall comprise a greater proportion of local species richness (18-72\% higher) and total abundance (21-144\% higher) in sites under substantial human use (secondary, agricultural and urban ecosystems) compared with nearby undisturbed habitats. The magnitude of this effect varies taxonomically and is strongest for rodent, bat and passerine bird zoonotic host species, which may be one factor that underpins the global importance of these taxa as zoonotic reservoirs. We further show that mammal species that harbour more pathogens overall (either human-shared or non-human-shared) are more likely to occur in human-managed ecosystems, suggesting that these trends may be mediated by ecological or life-history traits that influence both host status and tolerance to human disturbance5,6. Our results suggest that global changes in the mode and the intensity of land use are creating expanding hazardous interfaces between people, livestock and wildlife reservoirs of zoonotic disease.},

	abstract = {Many major human pathogens are multihost pathogens, able to infect other vertebrate species. Describing the general patterns of host–pathogen associations across pathogen taxa is therefore important to understand risk factors for human disease emergence. However, there is a lack of comprehensive curated databases for this purpose, with most previous efforts focusing on viruses. Here, we report the largest manually compiled host–pathogen association database, covering 2,595 bacteria and viruses infecting 2,656 vertebrate hosts. We also build a tree for host species using nine mitochondrial genes, giving a quantitative measure of the phylogenetic similarity of hosts. We find that the majority of bacteria and viruses are specialists infecting only a single host species, with bacteria having a significantly higher proportion of specialists compared to viruses. Conversely, multihost viruses have a more restricted host range than multihost bacteria. We perform multiple analyses of factors associated with pathogen richness per host species and the pathogen traits associated with greater host range and zoonotic potential. We show that factors previously identified as important for zoonotic potential in viruses—such as phylogenetic range, research effort, and being vector-borne—are also predictive in bacteria. We find that the fraction of pathogens shared between two hosts decreases with the phylogenetic distance between them. Our results suggest that host phylogenetic similarity is the primary factor for host-switching in pathogens.},

However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying their emergence remains rudimentary. Here we update a global database of emerging infectious disease ({EID}) events, create a novel measure of reporting effort, and fit boosted regression tree models to analyze the demographic, environmental and biological correlates of their occurrence. After accounting for reporting effort, we show that zoonotic {EID} risk is elevated in forested tropical regions experiencing land-use changes and where wildlife biodiversity (mammal species richness) is high. We present a new global hotspot map of spatial variation in our zoonotic {EID} risk index, and partial dependence plots illustrating relationships between events and predictors.

	abstract = {Leptospirosis essentially affects human following contact with rodent urine-contaminated water. As such, it was mainly found associated with rice culture, recreational activities and flooding. This is also the reason why it has mainly been investigated in temperate as well as warm and humid regions, while arid zones have been only very occasionally monitored for this disease. In particular, data for West African countries are extremely scarce. Here, we took advantage of an extensive survey of urban rodents in Niamey, Niger, in order to look for rodent-borne pathogenic Leptospira species presence and distribution across the city. To do so, we used high throughput bacterial 16S-based metabarcoding, {lipL}32 gene-targeting {RT}-{PCR}, rrs gene sequencing and {VNTR} typing as well as {GIS}-based multivariate spatial analysis. Our results show that leptospires seem absent from the core city where usual Leptospira reservoir rodent species (namely R. rattus and M. natalensis) are yet abundant. On the contrary, L. kirschneri was detected in Arvicanthis niloticus and Cricetomys gambianus, two rodent species that are restricted to irrigated cultures within the city. Moreover, the {VNTR} profiles showed that rodent-borne leptospires in Niamey belong to previously undescribed serovars. Altogether, our study points towards the importance of market gardening in maintain and circulation of leptospirosis within Sahelian cities. In Africa, irrigated urban agriculture constitutes a pivotal source of food supply, especially in the context of the ongoing extensive urbanization of the continent. With this in mind, we speculate that leptospirosis may represent a zoonotic disease of concern also in arid regions that would deserve to be more rigorously surveyed, especially in urban agricultural settings., We surveyed rodent-borne Leptospira in rodents from Niamey, the capital town of Niger, using bacterial metabarcoding, {RT}-{PCR}, sequencing, {VNTR} typing and {GIS}-based geostatistics. Two new serovars of Leptospira kirschneri were identified in Arvicanthis niloticus and Cricetomys gambianus, two species that inhabit exclusively urban irrigated gardens. Since no rodent-borne leptospires could be found in the core city, our results point towards the importance of urban agriculture in the maintaining and the circulation of these bacteria in cities from semi-arid regions where they are usually poorly documented and even hardly looked for. Accordingly, this is one of the very rare mentions of these zoonotic agents in Sahel, and the first one in Niger. Keeping in mind the critical role of urban gardening for food security in extensively growing West African cities, we believe that leptospirosis should be more closely scrutinized in Sahelian countries where numerous cases of human fevers are of unknown origin.},

	abstract = {As part of a large survey on reservoirs of Lassa fever in Guinea, three villages were investigated in high endemic zone, close to Sierra Leone border. Biodiversity of the small mammal community is presented in this study through a standardized trapping in houses, cultivations and forest. Identification of the small mammals was based on morphology and by molecular technique for sibling species. Of the 1123 specimens collected in 2003–2005, we identified seventeen species (thirteen Muridae, four Soricidae), leading to high diversity (Shannon index = 1.6–1.8) and high equitability (evenness index = 0.7–0.8) in cultivations and forest. In houses conversely, the rodent community was dominated by Mastomys natalensis (95–98\%), leading to low diversity and equitability. Dynamics and reproduction were investigated in two species of pygmy mice, Mus mattheyi and Mus minutoides, two species of Praomys, P. daltoni and P. rostratus, and in Mastomys erythroleucus. The pygmy mice were abundant in cultivations in early rainy season, and reproduced from rainy to dry season. Praomys daltoni was also found more abundant in cultivations and seemed to reproduce between rainy and dry season, whereas P. rostratus preferred forest and cultivations in late rainy season, and reproduced throughout the year. Finally, M. erythroleucus was more abundant in forest in dry season, and seemed to reproduce from late rainy to dry season. This species had a low occurrence (6.5\%) in the Faranah’s zone, and probably lived at its southern limit in Guinea. The presence of other Murinae, such as M. natalensis, Praomys spp as possible competitors in the same habitats, is discussed. For the first time, this study relates population biology of pygmy mice with molecular identification.},

	abstract = {Based on empiric surveillance data, the incidence of human Lassa fever ({LF}) cases in Guinea and other West African countries has been reported to increase during the dry season compared to the rainy season. To investigate possible links with the ecology of the rodent reservoir of the virus, we conducted a 2-year longitudinal survey of Mastomys natalensis in a region of high human Lassa virus ({LASV}) seropositivity in Guinea. Standardized rodent trapping with similar trapping efforts between seasons was performed in three villages and 53.5\% (601/1123) of the animals were identified as M. natalensis using morphometric and molecular criteria. Mean trapping success ({TS}) of M. natalensis was always higher inside houses than in proximal cultivations. In the dry season, mean {TS} increased 2-fold inside houses and decreased up to 10-fold outside (p {\textless} 0.0001), suggesting aggregation of rodents inside houses due to restricted food supply. 14.5\% (80/553) of M. natalensis were tested positive for Lassa virus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}; range, 5\%-30\%) and prevalence of the virus was two to three times higher in rodents captured in the rainy season than in the dry season (p {\textless} 0.05). Inside houses, however, the {LASV} prevalence fluctuated nonsignificantly with season. These data suggest that in Guinea the risk of {LASV} transmission from rodents to humans is present both in the rainy and the dry season, reflected by the occurrence of {LF} cases throughout the year. In the dry season, however, the increased risk of humans encountering Mastomys and their excreta inside of houses may result in an increase of human Lassa fever cases.},

To this end, we generated 132 partial nucleoprotein sequences of {LASV} from M. natalensis trapped in 12 villages around Faranah, Upper Guinea, over a period of 12 years. This study reveals two main features of {LASV} evolution in M. natalensis. First, the virus evolves in the reservoir with a molecular clock rate of 9 (7-11) × 10(-4) position(-1) year(-1) implying that contemporary {LASV} lineages circulate in the Faranah area since less than 100 years. Second, viruses circulating in a specific village are diverse and polyphyletic. We observed, however, there are monophyletic clusters at village and sub-village level at specific points in time. In conclusion, our data indicate that the temporal and spatial pattern of {LASV} evolution in the natural reservoir is characterized by a combination of stationary circulation within a village and virus movement between villages. The latter feature is relevant for rodent control strategies, as it implies that recurrence of the virus from neighbouring villages may occur in villages where the virus has previously been eradicated.},

	abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa virus ({LASV}), an arenavirus that causes Lassa haemorrhagic fever in humans in West Africa. While previous studies suggest that spillover risk is focal within rural villages due to the spatial behaviour of the rodents, the level of clustering was never specifically assessed. Nevertheless, detailed information on the spatial distribution of infected rodents would be highly valuable to optimize {LASV}-control campaigns, which are limited to rodent control or interrupting human–rodent contact considering that a human vaccine is not available. Here, we analysed data from a four-year field experiment to investigate whether {LASV}-infected rodents cluster in households in six rural villages in Guinea. Our analyses were based on the infection status (antibody or {PCR}) and geolocation of rodents (n = 864), and complemented with a phylogenetic analysis of {LASV} sequences (n = 119). We observed that the majority of infected rodents were trapped in a few houses (20\%) and most houses were rodent-free at a specific point in time (60\%). We also found that {LASV} strains circulating in a specific village were polyphyletic with respect to neighbouring villages, although most strains grouped together at the sub-village level and persisted over time. In conclusion, our results suggest that: (i) {LASV} spillover risk is heterogeneously distributed within villages in Guinea; (ii) viral elimination in one particular village is unlikely if rodents are not controlled in neighbouring villages. Such spatial information should be incorporated into eco-epidemiological models that assess the cost-efficiency of {LASV} control strategies.},

	abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa arenavirus, the etiological agent of Lassa fever in humans. Because there exists no vaccine for human use, rodent control and adjusting human behavior are currently considered to be the only options for Lassa fever control. In order to develop efficient rodent control programs, more information about the host's ecology is needed. In this study, we investigated the spatial behavior of M. natalensis and other small rodents in two capture-mark-recapture and four dyed bait (Rhodamine B) experiments in Lassa fever-endemic villages in Upper Guinea. During the capture-mark-recapture studies, 23\% of the recaptured M. natalensis moved between the houses and proximate fields. While M. natalensis was found over the entire study grid (2 ha), other rodent species (Praomys daltoni, Praomys rostratus, Lemniscomys striatus, Mus spp.) were mostly trapped in the surrounding fields. Distances between recapture occasions never exceeded 100 m for all rodent species. During the dyed bait experiments, 11\% of M. natalensis and 41\% of P. daltoni moved from the fields to houses. We conclude that commensal M. natalensis easily moves between houses and proximate fields in Guinea. We therefore consider occasional domestic rodent elimination to be an unsustainable approach to reduce Lassa virus transmission risk to humans, as M. natalensis is likely to reinvade houses quickly from fields in which rodents are not controlled. A combination of permanent rodent elimination with other control strategies (e.g., make houses rodent proof or attract predators) could be more effective for Lassa fever control, but must be further investigated.},

For 40 years, the Natal multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis, has been assumed to be the sole host of {LASV}. We found evidence that {LASV} is also hosted by other rodent species: the African wood mouse Hylomyscus pamfi in Nigeria, and the Guinea multimammate mouse Mastomys erythroleucus in both Nigeria and Guinea. Virus strains from these animals were isolated in the {BSL}-4 laboratory and fully sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of viral genes coding for glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, polymerase and matrix protein show that Lassa strains detected in M. erythroleucus belong to lineages {III} and {IV}. The strain from H. pamfi clusters close to lineage I (for S gene) and between {II} \& {III} (for L gene). Discovery of new rodent hosts has implications for {LASV} evolution and its spread into new areas within West Africa.},

Eight Lassa virus strains were isolated from tissues and blood of rodents identified in the field as being of 3 different species: Mastomys natalensis, Rattus rattus, and Mus minutoides. All the infected rodents were collected in village habitats. These isolations indicate the presence of Lassa virus in wild rodents in Nigeria during periods when no human infections were evident., Prior studies in Sierra Leone have indicated that a single rodent species, M. natalensis, may be the important reservoir host of Lassa virus. Since the present study indicates that other rodent species may be involved as well, the ecology of Lassa virus may be more complicated than was heretofore supposed. In view of the importance of determining the geographic and species range of rodent hosts of Lassa virus, and because of the problems inherent in rodent identification under austere field conditions, it is urgent that further studies be conducted in the same areas of Nigeria to confirm these findings.},

The remaining 401 specimens comprised twelve species. Weights, measurements and reproductive details were taken of each specimen. The distribution of larger rodents not caught in traps, but exposed as a result of bulldozed clearance of their habitat is discussed. The removal of high forest and its replacement by agriculture and domestic housing increased the numbers, biomass and diversity of small rodents. Seasonal changes in trap success were noted, but the patterns differed from one habitat to another. In general, more rodents were trapped during the rains of the second quarter than during the dry months of the first quarter of the year. Seasonal changes in the breeding of two rodent species were also noted although they differed from each other, and speculations on the reasons why the rodent population varied from habitat to habitat are discussed.},

We conducted a prospective study to detect L. major in rodents, animals which are described as reservoir of the parasite. Rodents were caught in five city areas from November 2005 to October 2006. Giemsa stained smears were realized from the cutaneous lesions when present after macroscopic examination of external lesions. The spleen of each rodent was sterilely removed and split into 3 parts for microscopic examination of smears, culture on {NNN} media and {PCR}, respectively. A total of 101 rodents belonging to 9 genera were trapped. All the direct examinations and cultures were negative. By using {PCR} of lesions and spleen samples, three animals were found infected by L. major: one out of 24 (4.2\%) Mastomys natalensis; one out of 8 (12.5\%) Taterillus sp. and one out of three Cricetomys gambianus. This is the first detection of L. major in rodent species in Burkina Faso. Further studies are needed to confirm their role as reservoirs of L. major.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Relapsing fever is the most frequent bacterial disease in Africa. Four main vector / pathogen complexes are classically recognized, with the louse Pediculus humanus acting as vector for B. recurrentis and the soft ticks Ornithodoros sonrai, O. erraticus and O. moubata acting as vectors for Borrelia crocidurae, B. hispanica and B. duttonii, respectively. Our aim was to investigate the epidemiology of the disease in West, North and Central Africa., {METHODS} {AND} {FINDINGS}: From 2002 to 2012, we conducted field surveys in 17 African countries and in Spain. We investigated the occurrence of Ornithodoros ticks in rodent burrows in 282 study sites. We collected 1,629 small mammals that may act as reservoir for Borrelia infections. Using molecular methods we studied genetic diversity among Ornithodoros ticks and Borrelia infections in ticks and small mammals. Of 9,870 burrows investigated, 1,196 (12.1\%) were inhabited by Ornithodoros ticks. In West Africa, the southern and eastern limits of the vectors and Borrelia infections in ticks and small mammals were 13degreeN and 01degreeE, respectively. Molecular studies revealed the occurrence of nine different Ornithodoros species, including five species new for science, with six of them harboring Borrelia infections. Only B. crocidurae was found in West Africa and three Borrelia species were identified in North Africa: B. crocidurae, B. hispanica, and B. merionesi., {CONCLUSIONS}: Borrelia Spirochetes responsible for relapsing fever in humans are highly prevalent both in Ornithodoros ticks and small mammals in North and West Africa but Ornithodoros ticks seem absent south of 13degreeN and small mammals are not infected in these regions. The number of Ornithodoros species acting as vector of relapsing fever is much higher than previously known.},

A total of 5931 trapnights and 200 pitfallnights yielded 767 small mammals, including 757 rodents of 12 species, as well as a few shrews and hedgehogs. Accumulation curve indicated that the rodent community was well sampled. Murine rodents were far more numerous than gerbilline rodents, and among them, Mastomys erythroleucus was the dominant species, being caught in high numbers in all habitats. Arvicanthis niloticus and Praomys daltoni were also abundant, followed by Mastomys natalensis and Gerbilliscus guineae. Abundances were high at the beginning of the rainy season when reproductive activity was low in all species. At the end of the rainy season, murine rodents were actively involved in reproduction, while gerbilline rodents were at their lowest density. Significant changes in relative abundance among habitats (including human dwellings) were observed between periods in some species, suggesting seasonal trends in habitat preferences. This may help species coexistence in this species-rich rodent community, in an area likely to be submitted to significant habitat alterations in the years to come.},

The black rat (Rattus rattus) is a major vertebrate invader with a worldwide distribution. Despite the severe ecological, economic and health impacts of this species, its evolutionary history has been little studied. We carried out extensive specimen sampling in Senegal, West Africa, and used microsatellite markers to describe the pattern and processes of invasion in this large continental area. The genetic data obtained were combined with historical knowledge concerning the presence of this species in Senegal. Data were analysed by a combination of Bayesian clustering and approximate Bayesian computation methods. The invasion pathways closely paralleled the history of human trade routes in Senegal. In several places, we detected the occurrence of multiple introductions from genetically different sources. Long-distance migration between towns and villages was also observed. Our findings suggest that genetic bottlenecks and admixture have played a major role in shaping the genetics of invasive black rats. These two processes may generate genetic novelty and favour rapid evolution along the invasion pathways.},

	abstract = {The taxonomic position of the westernmost representatives of the genus Dendromus in Africa is clarified herein associated with the recent capture of specimens in a range of habitats and elevations on Mount Nimba, Guinea. On the basis of morphological, morphometric and cytogenetic characters, we describe these animals as a new species. The distinguishing characteristics of the new species, with respect to D. melanotis and D. mystacalis from Gabon and Ghana, include the absence of a dorsal stripe and a larger body size. The new species is also smaller in size than D. oreas from Mount Cameroon. The new species has morphological similarities with karyo-typed specimens of D. messorius from Ippy (Central African Republic) and the so-called D. melanotis from La Maboke, Gabon, but has a distinct karyotype. It is close in morphology to D. messorius from the Cameroon lowlands. This is the first time G and C banding were employed for members of the genus Dendromus, and the karyotype of the new species confirms that it may be a sibling species of the D. messorius "complex", for which the distribution and measure of species diversity in west central Africa are far from resolved. The new species occurs in Guinean and Liberian montane savannas of Mount Nimba and in banana and quinine plantations around Mount Ziama, Guinea. It is also known from the Ivory Coast. The presence of this new species highlights the importance of altitude savannas and forests of the Nimba region for conservation.},

Prevalence and abundance levels of cestodes were very high in A. niloticus, especially in adults. Seasonal and habitat effects were found in both cestode communities of M. erythroleucus and A. niloticus.

	abstract = {Southward encroachment of the derived savanna zone with its attendant denudation of the rainforest in Nigeria adversely affects the diversity and distribution of mammals, particularly murid rodents. This study was carried out to establish the identities of murid rodent populations and to compare their diversity between forest and derived savanna sites within south western Nigeria. Identification of captured specimens was carried out by multivariate statistics of body and skull measurements, and also by analysis of certain discrete characters. Six species were identified: Praomys tullbergi, Hylomyscus stella, Mastomys natalensis, Arvicanthis rufinus, Lemniscomys striatus and Lophuromys sikapusi. Forest sites possessed a higher Shannon's diversity index (1.685) than the derived savanna sites (0.978), containing a higher number of taxa and larger abundance of murid rodents. This underscores the negative impact that encroachment of the derived savanna has upon diversity of animals in areas that were once forest.},

One other species is documented for the second time (Tatera cf. kempi), one for the third time (Crocidura lusitania). The known range of Gerbillus cf. gerbillus in Mali was extended further to the south. Rattus norvegicus was found for the first time in mainland Africa; formerly it was only known to occur in harbour towns. The most common rodent in the area was a yet unidentified form of Mastomys. By morphological characters the species is close to Mastomys natalensis and not to M. erythroleucus, a name applied by many authors. The commensal small mammal coenoses of some larger towns (Mopti, Djenne, Segou, Bamako) are compared.},

A total of 954 animals were caught during bimonthly capture sessions over a two-year period. Positive thick blood smears were recorded in 17.6\% of the 740 rodents and 7.3\% of the 55 musk shrews tested. Variations of prevalence were analyzed in Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys huberti, which represented 62.7\% and 28.3\%, respectively, of the animals captured, and 65.7\% and 27.6\%, respectively, of the animals found infected. Borrelia crocidurae prevalence was significantly different between captures and fluctuated separately for each species. Age-specific prevalence of B. crocidurae showed distinct patterns, decreasing with age from 50\% in younger juveniles to 3\% in older adults for A. niloticus, while increasing with age from 8\% to 23\% for M. huberti. No relationship was observed with animal abundance or with the season of the year for either species. These findings suggest that the diversity of the population dynamics of host-vector-parasite associations in the Sahel region of Senegal may be a key factor for the relative stability of the borreliosis reservoir.},

The small mammal fauna of Sierra Leone is poorly documented, although bats and rodents account for the majority of mammalian diversity. Based on morphological, genetic and echolocation data, we recorded 30 bat (Chiroptera), three shrew (Soricomorpha) and eleven rodent (Rodentia) species at the Seli River in the north of the country in 2014 and 2016, during a baseline study for the Bumbuna Phase {II} hydroelectric project. In 2016, 15 bat species were additionally documented at the western fringe of the Loma Mountains, a recently established national park and biodiversity offset for the Bumbuna Phase I dam. Three bat species were recorded for the first time in Sierra Leone, raising the total number for the country to 61. Further, two bat species are threatened and endemic to the Upper Guinean Forest and several taxa of small mammals are poorly known or represent undescribed species. Overall, the habitats of the project area supported a species-rich small mammal fauna including species of global conservation concern. Suitable mitigation measures and/or offsets are necessary to maintain biodiversity and ecosystems in a region that is under high human pressure.},

We surveyed wild small mammal populations in the areas of Richard Toll and Lake Guiers, Senegal, with the objective to evaluate their potential role as intermediate hosts of larval taeniid stages (i.e. metacestodes). Based on genetic sequences of a segment of the mitochondrial {DNA} gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 ({COI}), we identified Hydatigera parva metacestodes in 19 out of 172 (11.0\%) Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) and one out of six (16.7\%) gerbils (Taterillus sp.) and Hydatigera taeniaeformis sensu stricto metacestodes in one out of 215 (0.5\%) Nile rats (Arvicanthis niloticus). This study reports epidemiological and molecular information on H. parva and H. taeniaeformis in West African rodents, further supporting the phylogeographic hypothesis on the African origin of H. parva. Our findings may indicate significant trophic interactions contributing to the local transmission of Hydatigera spp. and other parasites with similar life-cycle mechanisms. We therefore propose that further field investigations of rodent population dynamics and rodent-borne infectious organisms are necessary to improve our understanding of host-parasite associations driving the transmission risks of rodent parasites in West Africa.},

	abstract = {Commensal rodent species are key reservoirs for Toxoplasma gondii in the domestic environment. In rodents, different T. gondii strains show variable patterns of virulence according to host species. Toxoplasma gondii strains causing non-lethal chronic infections in local hosts will be more likely to persist in a given environment, but few studies have addressed the possible role of these interactions in shaping the T. gondii population structure. In addition, the absence of validated techniques for upstream detection of T. gondii chronic infection in wild rodents hinders exploration of this issue under natural conditions. In this study, we took advantage of an extensive survey of commensal small mammals in three coastal localities of Senegal, with a species assemblage constituted of both native African species and invasive species. We tested 828 individuals for T. gondii chronic infection using the modified agglutination test for antibody detection in serum samples and a quantitative {PCR} assay for detection of T. gondii {DNA} in brain samples. The infecting T. gondii strains were genotyped whenever possible by the analysis of 15 microsatellite markers. We found (i) a very poor concordance between molecular detection and serology in the invasive house mouse, (ii) significantly different levels of prevalence by species and (iii) the autochthonous T. gondii Africa 1 lineage strains, which are lethal for laboratory mice, only in the native African species of commensal small mammals. Overall, this study highlights the need to reconsider the use of {MAT} serology in natural populations of house mice and provides the first known data about T. gondii genetic diversity in invasive and native species of small mammals from Africa. In light of these results, we discuss the role of invasive and native species, with their variable adaptations to different T. gondii strains, in shaping the spatial structure of T. gondii genetic diversity in Africa.

	abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa virus, an arenavirus that causes Lassa haemorrhagic fever in humans in West Africa. Because no vaccine exists and therapeutic options are limited, preventing infection through rodent control and human behavioural measures is currently considered to be the only option. In order to assess the efficacy of rodent control, we performed a 4-year field experiment in rural Upper Guinea and developed a mathematical model to simulate different control strategies (annual density control, continuous density control, and rodent vaccination). For the field study, rodenticide baits were placed each year in three rural villages, while three other villages were used as controls. Rodents were trapped before and after every treatment and their antibody status and age were determined. Data from the field study were used to parameterize the mathematical model. In the field study, we found a significant negative effect of rodent control on seroprevalence, but this effect was small especially given the effort. Furthermore, the rodent populations recovered rapidly after rodenticide application, leading us to conclude that an annual control strategy is unlikely to significantly reduce Lassa virus spillover to humans. In agreement with this finding, the mathematical model suggests that the use of continuous control or rodent vaccination is the only strategy that could lead to Lassa virus elimination. These field and model results can serve as a guide for determining how long and frequent rodent control should be done in order to eliminate Lassa virus in rural villages.},

	abstract = {Risks related to Toxoplasma gondii infection in humans remain poorly known in Senegal. Although rodent surveys could help to assess the circulation of T. gondii, they have seldom been set up in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to examine Toxoplasma seroprevalence in rodents from villages and towns across Senegal. Rodents were sampled in 40 localities using a standardised trapping protocol. Detection of T. gondii antibodies was performed on 1205 rodents, using a modified agglutination test ({MAT}) technique. Seroprevalence data were analysed depending on geography, the local rodent community, and individual characteristics of the rodent hosts. We found 44 seropositive rodents from four different species (Mastomys erythroleucus, Mastomys natalensis, Mus musculus domesticus, Rattus rattus). Toxoplasma seroprevalence was low, averaging 4\% in the localities. Higher Toxoplasma seroprevalence (up to 24\%) was found in northern Senegal, a region known to be the heart of pastoral herding in the country. Copyright © C.

We characterized the evolutionary relationships among multiple Schistosoma mansoni isolates collected from snails (intermediate hosts), humans (definitive hosts), and rodents (definitive hosts) in Senegal. On a local scale, diagnosis of S. mansoni infection ranged 3.8\%-44.8\% in school-aged children, 1.7\%-52.6\% in Mastomys huberti mice, and 1.8\%-7.1\% in Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails. Our phylogenetic framework confirmed the presence of multiple S. mansoni lineages that could infect both humans and rodents; divergence times of these lineages varied (0.13-0.02 million years ago). We propose that extensive movement of persons across West Africa might have contributed to the establishment of these various multihost S. mansoni clades. High S. mansoni prevalence in rodents at transmission sites frequented by humans further highlights the implications that alternative hosts could have on future public health interventions.},

In doing so, we document extant species distributions, which highlight the risks of continuing the range expansion of three synanthropic invasive rodent species, namely black rats (Rattus rattus), brown rats (R. norvegicus), and house mice (Mus musculus). Using various diversity estimates and community ecology approaches, we detect a latitudinal gradient of species richness that significantly decreased Northward. We show that shrews (Crocidura) represent a very important component of micro-mammal fauna in West African towns and villages, especially at lower latitudes. We also demonstrate that invasive and native synanthropic rodents do not distribute randomly in West Africa, which suggests that invasive species dynamics and history differ markedly, and that they involve gradual, as well as human-mediated, long distance dispersal. Patterns of segregation are also observed between native Mastomys natalensis and invasive rats R. rattus and R. norvegicus, suggesting potential native-to-invasive species turn over. Consequences of such processes, especially in terms of public health, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Trematodes of the genus Plagiorchis have a wide geographical distribution and can exploit a variety of hosts. The occurrence and zoonotic potential of Plagiorchis spp. have been characterised across several countries in Asia; in contrast, information on Plagiorchis parasites in Africa remains anecdotal. We isolated a previously undescribed Plagiorchis species from the biliary tract and small intestine of 201 out of 427 small mammals collected in the region of Lake Guiers, Senegal, with local prevalence ranging from 38.6\% to 77.0\%. Conversely, Plagiorchis isolates were not observed in the 244 small mammals sampled in and around the town of Richard Toll, Senegal. Molecular phylogenetics of the internal transcribed spacer region, nuclear ribosomal {DNA}, and of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene, mitochondrial {DNA}, supported the monophyly and multi-host spectrum of this newly discovered West African Plagiorchis species. Sequencing of individual cercariae shed by Radix natalensis (Gastropoda: Lymnaeidae) suggested that these freshwater snails may act as suitable first intermediate hosts. Phylogenetic analysis yielded a highly resolved topology indicating two different clades, one composed by Plagiorchis spp. infecting rodents, insectivores, and birds, while the other included parasites of bats. Our findings showed the low host specificity and high prevalence of the isolated Plagiorchis sp. in the Lake Guiers region, with Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) appearing to play a primary role in the epidemiology of this parasite. The results raise concern about the zoonotic potential of Plagiorchis sp. in local communities of the Lake Guiers region, and highlight food-borne trematodiases and their link to land-use change as a neglected public health issue in regions of West Africa.},

	abstract = {Usutu virus ({USUV}) is a Culex-associated mosquito-borne flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family. Since its discovery in 1959, the virus has been isolated from birds, arthropods and humans in Europe and Africa. An increasing number of Usutu virus infections in humans with neurological presentations have been reported. Recently, the virus has been detected in bats and horses, which deviates from the currently proposed enzootic cycle of {USUV} involving several different avian and mosquito species. Despite this increasing number of viral detections in different mammalian hosts, the existence of a non-avian reservoir remains unresolved. In Kedougou, a tropical region in the southeast corner of Senegal, Usutu virus was detected, isolated and sequenced from five asymptomatic small mammals: Two different rodent species and a single species of shrew. Additional molecular characterization and in vivo growth dynamics showed that these rodents/shrew-derived viruses are closely related to the reference strain (accession number: {AF}013412) and are as pathogenic as other characterized strains associated with neurological invasions in human. This is the first evidence of Usutu virus isolation from rodents or shrews. Our findings emphasize the need to consider a closer monitoring of terrestrial small mammals in future active surveillance, public health, and epidemiological efforts in response to {USUV} in both Africa and Europe.},

	abstract = {Background: Lassa fever, killing thousands of people annually, is the most reported viral zoonotic disease in Nigeria. Recently, different rodent species carrying diverse lineages of the Lassa virus ({LASV}) in addition to a novel Mobala-like genetic sequence were detected within the country. Here, screening 906 small mammal specimens from 11 localities for {IgG} antibodies and incorporating previous {PCR} detection data involving the same populations, we further describe arenavirus prevalence across Nigeria in relation to host species and geographical location. Methods: Small mammals were trapped during the period 2011-2015 according to geographical location (endemic and non endemic zones for Lassa fever), season (rainy and dry seasons between 2011 and 2012 for certain localities) and habitat (indoois, peridomestic settings and sylvatic vegetation). identification of animal specimens from genera such as Mastomys and Mus (Nannomys) was assisted by {DNA} sequencing. Small mammals were tested for {LASV} {IgG} antibody using an indirect immunofluorescence assay ({IFA}). Results: Small mammals were infected in both the endemic and non-endemic zones for Lassa fever, with a wider range of species {IgG}-positive (n = 8) than those which had been previously detected to be {PCR}-positive (n = 3). {IgG}-positive species, according to number of infected individuals, were Mastomys natalensis (n = 40), Mastomys erythroleucus (n = 15), Praomys daltoni (n = 6), Mus baoulei (n = 5), Rattus rattus (n = 2), Crocidura spp. (n = 2), Mus minutoides (n = 1) and Praomys misonnei (n = 1). Multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis and M. erythroleucus) were the most ubiquitously infected, with animals testing positive by either {PCR} or {IgG} in 7 out of the 11 localities sampled {IgG} prevalence in M. natalensis ranged from 1\% in Abagboro, 17-36\% in Eguare Egoro, Ekpoma and Ngel Nyaki, up to 52 \% in Mayo Ranewo. Prevalence according to locality, season and age was not, however, statistically significant for M. natalensis in Eguare Egoro and Ekpoma, localities that were sampled longitudinally. Conclusions: Overall, our study demonstrates that arenavirus occurrence is probably more widely distributed geographically and in extent of host taxa than is currently realized. This expanded scope should be taken into consideration in Lassa fever control efforts. further sampling should also be carried out to isolate and characterize potential arenaviruses present in small mammal populations we found to be seropositive.},

	abstract = {Ten species of rodents were trapped from cocoa groves, abandoned agricultural land and a rice field during the wet season in eastern Sierra Leone. Trap success varied between 0.8\% and 14.1\%. Mean corrected trap success was 6.4\%. Data are analyzed in terms of habitat preferences of individual species, community composition and species richness. Results of dietary analysis are presented. The data indicate that the rodent fauna of cocoa groves contains both savanna-derived and forest-derived elements, though some habitat specialist species were absent. Habitats with a high percentage of understory cover showed a higher rodent species diversity and biomass than those with a sparse understory. The habitats contained 43\% of the predicted small mammal fauna, including 33\% of the forest-dwelling species. Missing species were mostly arboreal forms. Cocoa groves may provide important refugia for forestderived small mammal species in areas where deforestation has been extensive.},

	abstract = {Statistical approaches for inferring the spatial distribution of taxa (Species Distribution Models, {SDMs}) commonly rely on available occurrence data, which is often clumped and geographically restricted. Although available {SDM} methods address some of these factors, they could be more directly and accurately modelled using a spatially-explicit approach. Software to fit models with spatial autocorrelation parameters in {SDMs} are now widely available, but whether such approaches for inferring {SDMs} aid predictions compared to other methodologies is unknown. Here, within a simulated environment using 1000 generated species’ ranges, we compared the performance of two commonly used non-spatial {SDM} methods (Maximum Entropy Modelling, {MAXENT} and boosted regression trees, {BRT}), to a spatial Bayesian {SDM} method (fitted using R-{INLA}), when the underlying data exhibit varying combinations of clumping and geographic restriction. Finally, we tested how any recommended methodological settings designed to account for spatially non-random patterns in the data impact inference. Spatial Bayesian {SDM} method was the most consistently accurate method, being in the top 2 most accurate methods in 7 out of 8 data sampling scenarios. Within high-coverage sample datasets, all methods performed fairly similarly. When sampling points were randomly spread, {BRT} had a 1–3\% greater accuracy over the other methods and when samples were clumped, the spatial Bayesian {SDM} method had a 4\%-8\% better {AUC} score. Alternatively, when sampling points were restricted to a small section of the true range all methods were on average 10–12\% less accurate, with greater variation among the methods. Model inference under the recommended settings to account for autocorrelation was not impacted by clumping or restriction of data, except for the complexity of the spatial regression term in the spatial Bayesian model. Methods, such as those made available by R-{INLA}, can be successfully used to account for spatial autocorrelation in an {SDM} context and, by taking account of random effects, produce outputs that can better elucidate the role of covariates in predicting species occurrence. Given that it is often unclear what the drivers are behind data clumping in an empirical occurrence dataset, or indeed how geographically restricted these data are, spatially-explicit Bayesian {SDMs} may be the better choice when modelling the spatial distribution of target species.},

In Asia alone, the rice loss every year caused by rodents could feed about 200 million people. Damage to crops in Africa and South America is equally dramatic. Rodent control often comes too late, is inefficient, or is considered too expensive. Using the multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) in Tanzania and the house mouse (Mus domesticus) in southeastern Australia as primary case studies, we demonstrate how ecology and economics can be combined to identify management strategies to make rodent control work more efficiently than it does today. Three more rodent–pest systems – including two from Asia, the rice-field rat (Rattus argentiventer) and Brandt's vole (Microtus brandti), and one from South America, the leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini) – are presented within the same bio-economic perspective. For all these species, the ability to relate outbreaks to interannual climatic variability creates the potential to assess the economic benefits of forecasting rodent outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Rodent pests are especially problematic in terms of agriculture and public health since they can inflict considerable economic damage associated with their abundance, diversity, generalist feeding habits and high reproductive rates. To quantify rodent pest impacts and identify trends in rodent pest research impacting on small-holder agriculture in the Afro-Malagasy region we did a systematic review of research outputs from 1910 to 2015, by developing an a priori defined set of criteria to allow for replication of the review process. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We reviewed 162 publications, and while rodent pest research was spatially distributed across Africa (32 countries, including Madagascar), there was a disparity in number of studies per country with research biased towards four countries (Tanzania [25\%], Nigeria [9\%], Ethiopia [9\%], Kenya [8\%]) accounting for 51\% of all rodent pest research in the Afro-Malagasy region. There was a disparity in the research themes addressed by Tanzanian publications compared to publications from the rest of the Afro-Malagasy region where research in Tanzania had a much more applied focus (50\%) compared to a more basic research approach (92\%) in the rest of the Afro-Malagasy region. We found that pest rodents have a significant negative effect on the Afro-Malagasy small-holder farming communities. Crop losses varied between cropping stages, storage and crops and the highest losses occurred during early cropping stages (46\% median loss during seedling stage) and the mature stage (15\% median loss). There was a scarcity of studies investigating the effectiveness of various management actions on rodent pest damage and population abundance. Our analysis highlights that there are inadequate empirical studies focused on developing sustainable control methods for rodent pests and rodent pests in the Africa-Malagasy context is generally ignored as a research topic.},

Our models predict reservoir status in this group with over 90\% accuracy, identifying species with high probabilities of harboring undiscovered zoonotic pathogens based on trait profiles that may serve as rules of thumb to distinguish reservoirs from nonreservoir species. Key predictors of zoonotic reservoirs include biogeographical properties, such as range size, as well as intrinsic host traits associated with lifetime reproductive output. Predicted hotspots of novel rodent reservoir diversity occur in the Middle East and Central Asia and the Midwestern United States.},

The database attempts to answer questions such as what are all the pathogens of a host, and what are all the hosts of a pathogen, what are all the countries where a pathogen was found, and what are all the pathogens found in a country. Two datasets were extracted from the database, focussing on species interactions and species distribution, based on evidence published between 1950–2012. The quality of their evidence was checked and verified against well-known, alternative, datasets of pathogens infecting humans, domestic animals and wild mammals. The presented datasets provide a valuable resource for researchers of infectious diseases of humans and animals, including zoonoses.},

	abstract = {Pathogens that spill over between species cause a significant human and animal health burden. Here, we describe characteristics of animal reservoirs that are required for pathogen spillover. We assembled and analyzed a database of 330 disease systems in which a pathogen spills over from a reservoir of one or more species. Three-quarters of reservoirs included wildlife, and 84\% included mammals. Further, 65\% of pathogens depended on a community of reservoir hosts, rather than a single species, for persistence. Among mammals, the most frequently identified reservoir hosts were rodents, artiodactyls, and carnivores. The distribution among orders of mammalian species identified as reservoirs did not differ from that expected by chance. Among disease systems with high priority pathogens and epidemic potential, we found birds, primates, and bats to be overrepresented. We also analyzed the life history traits of mammalian reservoir hosts and compared them to mammals as a whole. Reservoir species had faster life history characteristics than mammals overall, exhibiting traits associated with greater reproductive output rather than long-term survival. Thus, we find that in many respects, reservoirs of spillover pathogens are indeed special. The described patterns provide a useful resource for studying and managing emerging infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {The multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis Smith 1834, is a dominant species in agro-ecosystems in Sub-Saharan Africa, but adapts quickly to changes in non-agricultural landscape, particularly woodlands and forests. In this study we report on reproduction and population dynamics of M. natalensis in deforested high elevation localities in the Usambara Mountains, north-east Tanzania. We conducted Capture-Mark-Recapture studies in 2002-2004, and established that reproduction of M. natalensis takes place in the extended wet season between February and June, and the population density peaks in June-August. Reproduction cease in July to January and population density drops from July onwards. Reproduction and population density fluctuations are linked to the duration and amount of rainfall. In years when rainfall was below average and the wet season was short, the population density was significantly lower (below 10 animals/ha and 60 animals/ha in 2003 and 2004 respectively, compared to {\textgreater}100 animals/ha in 2002 when rainfall was above the seasonal average) (Fdf 2,13= 9.092, p {\textless} 0.01 for in between years variations and Fdf 12,15= 5.389, p {\textless} 0.01 for effect of cumulative annual rainfall on population density). These densities were much lower than in the lowland savannah habitats in central and southwest Tanzania. A comparison between the farmland/fallow mosaic fields and agro–forestry areas showed higher population densities in the former, which have similarities to the preferred habitats in the lowland savannahs. The increasing abundance of M. natalensis in the Usambara could have some consequences: M. natalensis is major pest and is involved in the plague cycle in the western Usambara Mountains. Mastomys natalensis is also a strong competitor and the impact on endemic rodent species, e.g. Lophuromys flavopunctatus and Praomys delectorum is unknown.},

	abstract = {West Africa faces an increasing challenge related to water resources in the coming decades; hence high-confidence climate projection is crucial for the region’s future. In this study, future changes in summer monsoon rainfall under the {RCP}8.5 scenario were investigated over West Africa for the period of 2074–2099 with respect to the present-day period of 1980–2005 using the Rossby Centre Regional Climate Model ({RCA}4), driven by six Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 ({CMIP}5) global circulation models ({GCMs}). Through evaluation of the present climate, the {RCA}4 simulations and their multi-model ensemble mean ({EnsMean}) reasonably reproduced the climatology of the summer rainfall and associated tropospheric circulation features. In a warmer climate, summer monsoon rainfall is projected to increase in most parts of West Africa, but a decrease is expected in the northwest, around Senegal. Changes in the monsoon circulation are opposite in the lower and upper troposphere, with the tipping point at 400 {hPa}. Specifically, a projected strengthening and northward shift is observed at the lower and mid-tropospheric level, while weakening is evident at the upper tropospheric level. A diagnosis based on a moisture budget equation reveals that the robust positive response of West African summer monsoon rainfall to global warming is largely explained by the enhancement of moisture convergence and surface evaporation.},

Fifty individuals of nine species of rodents were recorded, with Mastomys erythroleucus (multimammate mouse) being the most abundant. Small mammal species diversity was highest (H’ = 1.88) and lowest (H’ = 0.98) in Tain {II} and Tain I forest reserves, respectively. The presence of some savanna species in some of the reserves indicated high levels of degradation. Fifty-four bird species, representing 22 families, were recorded, with 16 of the species being under national conservation protection. It is recommended that the reserves be zoned into smaller management areas to enable more efficient management, through initiation of reforestation programmes, anti-poaching patrols, research, and long-term monitoring.

Between 2009 and 2013, 108 black rats (Rattus rattus) and 77 mice (Mus musculus) were analysed for the presence of Coxiella and Toxoplasma antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ({ELISA}) and indirect immunofluorescence ({IFA}), respectively. Our results showed a wide distribution of C. burnetii and T. gondii, except for T. gondii in Cape Verde, in both rodent species. The overall seroprevalence of C. burnetii antibodies was 12.4\%; 21.1\% for Cape Verde and 10.2\% for the Canary Islands. With respect to T. gondii, seropositive rodents were only observed in the Canary Islands, with an overall seroprevalence of 15\%. Considering the fact that both pathogens can infect a large range of hosts, including livestock and humans, the results are of public health and veterinary importance and could be used by governmental entities to manage risk factors and to prevent future cases of Q fever and toxoplasmosis.},

In recent years there is an increasing interest in mammalian bartonelloses in general and in rodent bartonelloses in particular. To date, no studies investigating the presence of Bartonella spp. in rodents and ectoparasites from Nigeria were carried out. Methodology/Principal Findings: The aim of the current study was to investigate the presence of Bartonella spp. in commensal rodents and their ectoparasites in Nigeria. We report, for the first time, the molecular detection of Bartonella in 26\% (46/177) of commensal rodents (Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus and Cricetomys gambianus) and 28\% (9/32) of ectoparasite pools (Xenopsylla cheopis, Haemolaelaps spp., Ctenophthalmus spp., Hemimerus talpoides, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus) from Nigeria. Sequence analysis of the citrate synthase gene ({gltA}) revealed diversity of Bartonella spp. and genotypes in Nigerian rodents and their ectoparasites. Bartonella spp. identical or closely related to Bartonella elizabethae, Bartonella tribocorum and Bartonella grahamii were detected. Conclusions/Significance: High prevalence of infection with Bartonella spp. was detected in commensal rodents and ectoparasites from Nigeria. The Bartonella spp. identified were previously associated with human diseases highlighting their importance to public health. Further studies need to be conducted to determine whether the identified Bartonella species could be responsible for human cases of febrile illness in Nigeria.},

	abstract = {Expansion of human activities in the Sudanian savannah is changing natural habitats together with their animal communities. The abundance and diversity of small mammal communities were investigated in human-influenced savannahs in close proximity to Niokolo Koba National Park ({NKNP}) in south-eastern Senegal and compared with those from {NKNP}. Two localities were sampled in natural and two in human-influenced areas during two dry and two rainy seasons. Total sampling effort was 5400 trap-nights. Ninety-eight individuals of eleven species were captured outside {NKNP}, while only 28 individuals of five rodent species were caught inside the park (all of which were found also outside {NKNP}). The most abundant species outside {NKNP} was Mastomys erythroleucus, while inside {NKNP} it was Praomys daltoni. Both relative abundance and diversity were significantly higher in human-influenced landscape than in natural savannahs of {NKNP}. The difference in species richness may be linked with lower population densities of certain species in {NKNP} and the effect of traditional agriculture, which may support the presence of species typical for deforested landscape. Furthermore, food availability, and predator abundances are discussed as possible reasons for the higher rodent abundances outside {NKNP}.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus ({LASV}). It is a deadly rodent-borne zoonosis with outbreaks occurring mostly in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria, in West Africa. In Sierra Leone, surveillance activities of {LASV} focus mainly on the Kenema area in the eastern region, known to be the epicentre. Little is known about the presence of the virus in the Bo area, where Mastomys natalensis and Rattus rattus share habitats with humans. Our study investigated the circulation and phylogeny of new {LASV} strains and virus seroprevalence in rodent populations of villages in Bo district. Information provided here will be of great importance in prioritizing areas for Lassa fever surveillance and preventive measures to mitigate future outbreaks. Our rodent longitudinal survey carried out over two years (2014-2016) identified Mastomys natalensis as the most prevalent species. While seropositive small mammals were found in every village, the four Mastomys natalensis rodents that tested {PCR}-positive for Lassa virus were found in only two villages. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these sequences belong to the Sierra Leonean clade, within lineage {IV}. In conclusion, {LASV} is present, with low circulation, in small mammals in rural settings around Bo. Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus {LASV}, which was first isolated in the rodent Mastomys natalensis in 1974 in Kenema, Sierra Leone. As little is known about the abundance and the presence of {LASV} in rodents living in the Bo area, we carried out a small mammal longitudinal population survey. A standardized trapping session was performed in various habitats and seasons in six villages over two years (2014-2016) and samples collected were tested for arenavirus {IgG} and {LASV}. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed on sequences identified by {PCR}. A total of 1490 small mammals were collected, and 16 rodent species were identified, with M. natalensis (355, 24\%) found to be the most prevalent species. Forty-one (2.8\%) samples were {IgG} positive, and 31 of these were trapped in homes and 10 in surrounding vegetation. Twenty-nine of 41 seropositive rodents were M. natalensis. We detected four {LASV} by {PCR} in two villages, all found in M. natalensis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences were distributed within the Sierra Leonean clade within lineage {IV}, distinguishing a Bo sub-clade older than a Kenema sub-clade. Compared to other settings, we found a low abundance of M. natalensis and a low circulation of {LASV} in rodents in villages around Bo district.},

A set of different methods of trapping was used in order to evaluate the composition of the species at the level of both the ground-dwelling and the arboreal guilds. For the Insectivora, six shrew species were trapped, but only two (Crocidura nigeriae and C. poensis) appeared abundant and widespread in the various habitat types. No arboreal species were found. For the rodents, 17 species were captured, which were arranged by a Principal Component Analysis into four groups: (1) Rattus rattus and Anomalurus derbianus; (2) Xerus erythropus and Grammomys rutilans; (3) Graphiurus cf. murinus and Hylomyscus stella; (4) the remaining, more generalist species. For the ground-dwelling rodents, 14 species were found, which were arranged in three groups: (1) Malacomys edwardsi and Grammomys sp.; (2) Mylomys dybowskii and Rattus norvegicus; (3) all the other species, with stronger similarities between Praomys tullbergi, Mus musculoides, Aethomys sp. (unknown), and Lemniscomys striatus. Although an approximately equal number of species constituted the arboreal and grounddwelling rodent fauna, the number of trapped animals was much higher on the ground than at the level of the arboreal guild (ratio 8.7: 1; total n = 2322). The general implications of the patterns observed are discussed.},

Two rarely recorded bat species (Hypsugo [crassulus] bellieri and Pipistrellus aﬀ. grandidieri) are reported for the ﬁrst time for Ghana, raising the total number of species for this country to 86. Together with specimens from ﬁve localities in West Africa, Pipistrellus aﬀ. grandidieri from Atewa might represent an undescribed species. Hypsugo (crassulus) bellieri is endemic to the Upper Guinean forests. Zenker’s fruit bat Scotonycteris zenkeri is ranked on the Red List as Near Threatened ({IUCN} 2006). The three terrestrial small mammal species recorded during the survey are likewise forest-dependent and include two West African endemics: Edward’s swamp rat Malacomys edwardsi and the shrew Crocidura grandiceps. The latter is ranked as Near Threatened on the {IUCN} Red List and had not been recorded from Ghana since its description. The overall species composition of small mammals indicates high habitat integrity of the Atewa Range Forest Reserve, which constitutes the most signiﬁcant block of Upland Evergreen Forest in Ghana. The integral protection of Atewa is an outstanding priority for the preservation of (sub-) montane forests in West Africa, both for the conservation of small mammals and of biodiversity in general. In accordance with international conservation principles on mining and biodiversity (Dudley and Stolton 2002, Miranda et al. 2005), we recommend that exploration concessions for Atewa are cancelled, that its legal protection status is upgraded, that no development is allowed within the forest reserve, and that eﬀective management measures are implemented.},

              The Upper Guinea rainforest zone in West Africa is considered a biodiversity hotspot and contains important habitats for threatened and endemic mammals, yet this region remains poorly known particularly for small mammals. The aim of this study was to survey small mammals in a Liberian and Guinean cross-border conservation area, the Ziama-Wonegizi-Wologizi landscape. We recorded a total of 52 small mammal species, including 26 bats, 15 rodents, 10 shrews, one otter-shrew, of which one rodent species was new to science (
              Colomys

            Population genetic approaches may be used to investigate dispersal patterns of species living in highly urbanized environment in order to improve management strategies for biodiversity conservation or pest control. However, in such environment, population genetic structure may reflect both current features of the cityscape and urbanization history. This can be especially relevant when focusing on exotic commensal rodents that have been introduced in numerous primary colonial European settlements. Accounting for spatial and temporal cityscape heterogeneity to determine how past and recent demographic events may interplay to shape current population genetic structure of synanthropic rodents may provide useful insights to manage their populations. In this study, we addressed these issues by focusing on the house mouse,
            Mus musculus domesticus
            , in Dakar, Senegal, where the species may have been introduced as soon as Europeans settled in the middle of the nineteenth century. We examined genetic variation at one mitochondrial locus and 15 nuclear microsatellite markers from individuals sampled in 14 sampling sites representing different stages of urbanization history and different socio-economic environments in Dakar. We used various approaches, including model-based genetic clustering and model-free smoothing of pairwise genetic estimates. We further linked observed spatial genetic patterns to historical and current features of Dakar cityscape using random forest and Bayesian conditional autoregressive models. Results are consistent with an introduction of the house mouse at colonial time and the current genetic structure exhibits a gradient-like pattern reflecting the historical process of spatially continuous expansion of the city from the first European settlement. The genetic patterns further suggest that population dynamics of the house mouse is also driven by the spatial heterogeneity of the current cityscape, including socio-economics features, that translate in habitat quality. Our results highlight the potential importance of accounting for past demographic events to understand spatial genetic patterns of nonnative invasive commensal rodents in highly urbanized environment.},

	abstract = {Gerbillus nigeriae is a sand-dwelling and semi-arid adapted rodent species restricted to the West African Sahel where it causes extensive damages to cereal crops such as millet and sorghum. It also displays one of the most extensive floating chromosomal polymorphisms currently known in mammals, showing a non-random spatial distribution of diploid numbers (2N). We combined population dynamics and genetics to determine dispersal and mobility parameters of G. nigeriae in the species distribution range characterized by low 2N. To do so, we performed a three-year long population survey at Gangara, in the central east Niger. We used both time-dependent monitoring trough capture-mark-recapture ({CMR}) methods and genetic analyses performed on the 134 monitored individuals. {CMR} results showed low to very low population densities (maximum 27.5 individuals/ha) throughout the study. Abundance cycle was single-phased and strongly dependent on rainfall patterns. Mobility parameters showed very low individual mobility, with means of distance between successive (re) captures ({DRS}) and maximal distance between (re) captures ({DMR}) of 7.8 and 14.4 meters, respectively. Genetic analyses revealed significant isolation by distance as well as spatial structuration, thus confirming poor dispersal capacity. Our results are discussed in terms of rodent pest control in arid areas of Niger where cereal crops production is crucial for human food security.},

It has been recommended as a complementary study to design a biological baseline prior to the development of oil palm plantations. It is based on "Terrestrial small mammals” biological model. Thus, terrestrial small mammal richness and abundance were assessed in Sime Darby palm oil company Concession at Bong and Gbarpolu counties in western Liberia. Conventional live-trapped methods using mainly pitfalls and Sherman traps were used to investigate terrestrial small mammals. The combination of these two methods allowed the capture of 76 specimens belonging to 11 species. The most frequent species was Crocidura jouvenetae (39.47 \%) followed by Hylomyscus simus (14.47 \%) and Hybomys planifrons (10.53 \%). Small mammal communities were globally dominated by forest species (Crocidura eburnea, Crocidura jouvenetae, Crocidura muricauda, Crocidura obscurior, Dephomys defua, Hybomys planifrons, Hylomyscus simus and Mus setulosus), which indicates the lower level of forest degradation at this area. These species of rodent and shrew are threatened to disappear due to the conversion of their habitats to palm oil plantations. It is highly recommended that the company preserve intact primary forest relics within oil palm plantations in order to conserve representative sample local biodiversity.},

Overall, 39 individuals belonging to three mammalian orders (Rodentia, Soricomorpha and Erinaceomorpha) and seven species, comprising of four rodents, two shrews and one hedgehog were recorded in 1,080 trap-nights. Overall trapping success and species diversity (Shannon-Wiener H’ and Simpson’s 1-D) indices were therefore 3.61\%, 1.59 and 0.76, respectively. Species richness and diversity were highest (four species; Hʹ = 1.33, 1-D = 0.72) in shrubland and lowest (two species; Hʹ = 0.48, 1-D = 0.3) in grassland. Overlaps of species among the study sites were low, with C. olivieri being the only species common to all sites. Crocidura olivieri was the most abundant species (41.2\%) in the forest, whereas M. erythroleucus dominated (81.3\%) in the grassland. Arvicanthis niloticus solatus and C. oliviera were equally abundant in shrubland. Arvicanthis n. solatus, P. daltoni, C. oliviera, C. foxi and A. albiventris are first records for the Accra Plains. These records add to the species list for the Accra Plains, and highlight the importance of the {UGBG} to small mammal zoogeography and conservation in Ghana.},

	abstract = {The endemicity of Buruli ulcer ({BU}), a non-tuberculous mycobacteria infection, has significantly increased in Côte d'Ivoire. The exact transmission mode remains unknown but {DNA} based evidence of Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent, have implicated potential environmental reservoirs, similar to those suspected in the transmission to humans. The role of small mammals in transmission has recently received some research attention. Based on the hypothesis that the overlapping ecology of human and animal habitats would favour mycobacteria transmission, the study aimed to identify {BU} like infections in small mammals living in close proximity to humans, in endemic communities. One hundred and eleven animals were trapped within five communities in two major endemic areas, Daloa and Tabbo. Majority of trapped small mammals were mice, Mastomys natalensis, of which 8 animals had external lesions. {PCR} on organ and lesion samples identified, predominantly, mycobacterium spp, of which five mice were positive for {IS}2404. {IS}2404 sequencing confirmed infection in two mice as M. ulcerans strain Agy99. Our findings suggest that small terrestrial mammals could be susceptible to mycobacteria, particularly, M. ulcerans, within endemic communities in Côte d’Ivoire. It also consolidates earlier evidence asserting their role as potential environmental reservoirs of M. ulcerans in endemic communities. The potential public health threat from these small mammals warrants an “{OneHealth}” approach to investigating the ecology and transmission of M. ulcerans in endemic countries.},

	abstract = {Bats were sampled in three National Forests in Liberia using mist nets, a harp trap, and roost searches. Terrestrial small mammals were captured opportunistically and were not used in the final assessment of the forests. A total of 182 bats of 22 species was captured, representing 37\% of the bat species known to occur in Liberia. Species richness was highest at Gola and Grebo National Forests, possibly because secondary forest and forest edge was sampled there. North Lorma National Forest, where only forest interior was surveyed, had both the lowest capture success and the lowest species richness. Three {IUCN} Red List species were recorded: Rhinolophus hillorum (Vulnerable) in Gola National Forest, Scotonycteris zenkeri (Near Threatened) in Grebo National Forest, and Hipposideros fuliginosus (Near Threatened) in North Lorma National Forest. Bat assemblages in each of the surveyed areas were characterized by forestdependent species. Not a single species typical of savanna habitats was recorded, indicating high habitat integrity of the National Forests. Three species are reported for the first time from Liberia (Rhinolophus landeri, Neoromicia guineensis, Neoromicia aff. grandidieri), raising the species total for the country to 59. An updated checklist with corrected species identifications is presented for the bats of Liberia. Two species of shrews, one murid rodent, five squirrels and one anomalure (scaly-tailed squirrel) were also recorded, including the rarely reported Western Palm Squirrel Epixerus ebii and the Lesser Anomalure Anomalurus cf. pusillus.},

	abstract = {Small mammals (shrews, rodents and bats) were surveyed in the Ajenjua Bepo and Mamang River forest reserves of eastern Ghana. A total of 128 specimens belonging to at least 18 species were recorded including ﬁve species of rodent, six species of shrew and seven bat species. Within Ajenjua Bepo, six shrew species were recorded including four forest species. Despite the high degree of disturbance of the secondary forest, three specimens of Crocidura muricauda were collected. Only three species of murid rodents were collected, with two forest species (Malacomys edwardi and Praomys tullbergi). Six pteropodid bat species and a single insectivorous bat species were recorded. Several of these species were forest-dwelling species. Within the Mamang River Forest Reserve, ﬁve or six shrew species were collected, the dominant species being the forest-dwelling Crocidura obscurior. With a similar trapping eﬀort as at Site 1, a higher number of specimens (39) and species (5) of rodents were recorded within Mamang River. The forest-dwelling Praomys tullbergi was dominant. Only four specimens of a single forest-dwelling bat species (Myonycteris torquata) were recorded within the forest, most likely a result of weather conditions during surveys. Both species richness and species abundance of the forest shrew and murid rodent species point to a higher conservation potential of Mamang River than Ajenjua Bepo. Mamang River appears to present better conservation value due to 1) its larger size, 2) the absence of plantations within Mamang, and 3) the more structured arboreal vegetation within Mamang probably providing more fruit and leaf litter.},

	abstract = {Although several studies have associated Mycobacterium ulcerans ({MU}) infection, Buruli ulcer ({BU}), with slow moving water bodies, there is still no definite mode of transmission. Ecological and transmission studies suggest Variable Number Tandem Repeat ({VNTR}) typing as a useful tool to differentiate {MU} strains from other Mycolactone Producing Mycobacteria ({MPM}). Deciphering the genetic relatedness of clinical and environmental isolates is seminal to determining reservoirs, vectors and transmission routes. In this study, we attempted to source-track {MU} infections to specific water bodies by matching {VNTR} profiles of {MU} in human samples to those in the environment. Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four {BU} endemic communities in the Ashanti region, Ghana. Four {VNTR} loci in {MU} Agy99 genome, were used to genotype environmental {MU} ecovars, and those from 14 confirmed {BU} patients within the same study area. Length polymorphism was confirmed with sequencing. {MU} was present in the 3 different types of water bodies, but significantly higher in biofilm samples. Four {MU} genotypes, designated W, X, Y and Z, were typed in both human and environmental samples. Other reported genotypes were only found in water bodies. Animal trapping identified 1 mouse with lesion characteristic of {BU}, which was confirmed as {MU} infection. Our findings suggest that patients may have been infected from community associated water bodies. Further, we present evidence that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to {MU} infections. M. ulcerans transmission could involve several routes where humans have contact with risk environments, which may be further compounded by water bodies acting as vehicles for disseminating strains.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate dynamics and reproduction in Mastomys erythroleucus inhabiting a high rainfall area in coastal Guinea, West Africa, a small mammal study was carried out through a 1-year longitudinal survey. Sampling was by standardized trapping in houses, cultivations, forest and savanna. Identification of the small mammals was based on morphology, and by molecular technique for sibling species. As a part of a larger survey on reservoirs of Lassa virus in Guinea, 106/289 specimens were screened for arenavirus and were found negative. The most abundant species was M. erythroleucus (46\%) which occurred in all habitats, with a preference for savanna close to the cultivations. Its reproduction was seasonal and lasted for 8 months, beginning in the early rainy season and finishing in the early dry season. It was syntopic with Lophuromys sikapusi (13\%) and Praomys rostratus (10\%), which probably migrated from forest/orchards to cultivations in the late rainy season. Reproduction was high in many species in the late rainy season, but P. rostratus seemed to reproduce actively in the dry season, in contrast to L. sikapusi. Pygmy mice, Mus (Nannomys) spp., were abundant in the early rainy season only. The high species richness (14) is explained by the combined influence of Sudanian-Guinean-Congolian habitats. The role of the absence of bush fires is also debated in that context.},

Among them, invasive species such as rats and mice are of particular concern since they are disseminated globally following international trade. We investigated the small mammal assemblage within the international seaport of Cotonou, Benin, in order to determine the relative importance and distribution of native vs invasive rodent species, as well as to evaluate the amount and associated costs of rodent-induced damages on imported 'exported stored goods (here, rice). Objectives. Description of rodent assemblages within an African seaport, and evaluation of the associated damages on stored food stocks. Method. Rodent communities were described following trapping results while associated damages and costs were evaluated following a 25 days-long monitoring campaign and subsequent economic estimation of loss. Results. Our results show that invasive mice and rats are, from far, the most impacting rodents in the storage warehouses, and that the associated economic losses are quite large. Moreover, we point towards a few environmental management procedures that may greatly reduce the impact of rodents on stored goods. Conclusions. Damages and costs due to invasive rodents within the Cotonou Harbor are so that they justify financial investment in rodent population control.},

Small mammals were used because they are relatively easy to survey and serve as bio-indicators that provide knowledge on the state of health of the habitat in which they inhabit. The University of Ghana Campus, Legon ({UGCL}) was divided into two sites: built-up area and the botanical garden, which is less developed. The small mammals were live-trapped using Sherman traps in May 2009 for seven nights by means of transect in the two study sites, using a mixture of peanut butter and corn meal as the preferred bait. The 350 trap-nights yielded 68 captures of five species of small mammals. They were (i) Pygmy mouse (Mus musculoides), (ii) Unstriped grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus), (iii) Tullberg's soft-furred rat (Praomys tullbergi), (iv) African giant shrew (Crocidura olivieri) and (v) White-bellied hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris). Small mammal diversity and abundance were similar between the two sites. This may be due to the comparatively large size and the presence of green areas in the built-up area. The preference of C. olivieri for human-interfered habitats may be used to monitor further habitat modification through real estate development in {UGCL}.},

	abstract = {In this study, the impact of habitat characteristics on the abundance and relative distribution of wild black rats (Rattus rattus) as influenced by human activities was investigated in Yenagoa and its environs in Bayelsa state of Nigeria. Consequently three ecological zones namely: 1.zone of stable urban centre, 2.zone of rapid urban transformation, and 3.zone of undisturbed rural centre were mapped out with three ecological subsets from each zone. These subsets include; site A-undisturbed landscape area, site B-stable human settlement area and site C-refuse dump site area. Standard trapping procedures were then adopted using bread and raw cassava as baits. A total of 1411 black rats were caught in 1002 trap nights representing a mean trap success of 46.9\%. The relative abundance of rats caught were highest in zone 2 with 46.4\% and lowest in zone 1 with 11.9\%. An analysis of variance indicated that there was a significant difference in the abundance of rats in the various study zones( Fcal = 1.626, {MSE} = 21168.11, p{\textless}0.05). A Post Hoc analysis also shows a significant difference on the influence of site structure on black rat population. It is therefore worthwhile to conclude that black rat can be used as bioindicator to monitor the ecosystem health in an environment of growing human population.},

Altogether 1458 rats (56.5 \% ma/es and 43.5 \% females) were trapped and examined for helminths. A total of 1098 rats (55.7 \% ma/es and 44.3\% females) harboured helminth parasites thus providing and overall prevalence of 75.3\% and a mean worn burden 01.3. The between-sex difference was statistically significant =2.64, P {\textless} 0.05) with more ma/es (53.2 \%) than females (46.8 \%) harbouring helminth parasites. There was no marked variation in the infection pattern in the rat host from the different habitats, but the parasite prevalence and distribution appeared to be season-dependent. Parasites (n = 1469) recovered were of 3 helminth groups (nematodes 72.4\%, cestodes 27,5\%, and trematodes 0.6\%). Six nematode species identified were Nippostrongylus braziliensis (19.8\%), Aspicularis tetraptera (17.5\%), Syphacia muris 17,0 \%), Angiostrongy/us cantonensis 16.9\%), Strongy/oides ratti (16.0\%) and Capi//aria hepatica (12,8\%). Also recovered from their rat hosts were the following six cestode species; Hymenolepis diminuta (22,7\%), Taenia taeniaeformis (17.4\%), T. muris (17.1 \%), T. hydatigera (16.6\%), H. nana (16.4\%) and Raillietina muris (9.8\%), Trematodes (n=9) belonging to 3 species, Plagiochis muris, Platynosomoides muris and Corrigia muris were also recovered from five infected rats. A total of 103 rat hosts harboured single infections of nematodes, 818 (98.9\%) had combined nematode/cestode infections, 5 (6.0\%) haboured a combination of nematode/trematode whereas 4 (0.5\%) showed concurrent cestode/trematode infections The influence of seasonal fluctuations on the parasite-host relationship, life cycle patterns of the parasites and immunological potentials of the rat hosts are discussed.},

Twenty five R. rattus (16 and 9) captured within {AEL} and 15 (9 and 6) (control) caught from Iyano Ipaja (10 km away from {AEL}) were examined for bone marrow micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes ({MNPCE}) and polychromatic erythrocytes/normochromatic erythrocytes ({PCE}/{NCE}) ratio, abnormal sperm morphology, alterations in hematological indices and erythrocyte morphology, and histopathology of the viscera using standard protocols. There was significant (p {\textless} 0.05) increase in {MNPCE} but decrease {PCE}/{NCE} ratio in bone marrow cells of exposed rats than the reference site. {MNPCE} was insignificantly higher in male than females. Cauda epididymal sperms from exposed rats showed significant high frequency of teratozoospermia. Erythrocyte count, hemoglobin concentrations, percentage hematocrits, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations, leucocyte count, and lymphocytes decreased while mean corpuscular volume, neutrophils, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin increased in the exposed rats compared to the control. Also, abnormal erythrocyte morphology: acanthocytes, codocytes (target cells), schizocytes, and tear drops significantly increased in the exposed rats. Marginal sexual dimorphism was observed between males and females in the incidence of hematological indices. Histopathological lesions including interstitial edema, hemorrhage, lymphoid depletion, cellular infiltrations, proliferation of the alveolar pneumocytes, necrosis, tissue degeneration, and reduced germinal epithelium were observed in the testes, liver, lungs, heart, kidney, and spleen from the exposed rats compared to the control. Some physicochemicals and metals analyzed in leachates from the landfill are capable of inducing genome instability and systemic toxicity in the exposed rats. Rattus rattus exposed to hazardous chemicals from {AEL} harbored somatic and germ cell mutations, and tissue damage compared to the control rats. We suggest that R. rattus are useful sentinel for genotoxicity and system toxicity assessment of landfill-polluted sites.Graphical abstract.},

All 32-chromosome animals exhibited a single hemoglobin pattern, whereas those with 38-chromosomes had four distinguishable patterns. Both karyotypes were present throughout Sierra Leone. The 38-chromosome species was more prevalent in the Guinea savanna zone to the north, while the 32-chromosome species was most dominant in human-modified high forest areas of the eastern and southern parts of the country. In almost all situations the 32-chromosome species was more common in houses than in bush habitats; the reverse was true for Mastomys having 38 chromosomes. Analysis of hemoglobin patterns thus becomes useful for species identification, and is necessary to understand the roles of the different Mastomys forms as reservoirs of human diseases, such as Lassa fever in West Africa.},

Five isolates were recovered from 74 bovine kidneys examined: one was serovar pyrogenes and four unidentified. One unidentified isolate failed to react with any of the 16 screening leptospira antisera and another was tentatively considered to be serovar ballum. Two isolates, one ballum and one unidentified, were recovered from the Kubani stream waters. No leptospira was isolated from piggery sewage effluents collected at Kano and Kaduna.

Using molecular tools, we assessed the prevalence of bacteria and protozoans in small mammals and their ectoparasites in Faladje, Bougouni, and Bamako, Mali. A total of 130 small mammals belonging to 10 different species were captured, of which 74 (56.9\%) were infested by ectoparasites, including Laelaps echidnina, Xenopsylla cheopis, Amblyomma variegatum, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, and Haemaphysalis spp. nymphs. {DNA} of Bartonella was found in 14/75 (18.7\%), 6/48 (12.5\%), and 3/7 (42.8\%) small mammals from Faladje, Bougouni, and Bamako, respectively. In Faladje, Bartonella {DNA} was detected in 31/68 (45.6\%) of L. echidnina and 14/22 (63.6\%) of X. cheopis. In Bougouni, it was found in 2/26 (7.7\%) of L. echidnina and 10/42 (23.8\%) of X. cheopis. The sequences of Bartonella obtained from small mammals were close to those of Bartonella mastomydis, Bartonella elizabethae, and uncultured Bartonella spp. In Faladje, Coxiella burnetii {DNA} was detected in 64.4\% (29/45) of Haemaphysalis spp. ticks, 4.5\% (2/44) of Mastomys erythroleucus, 12.5\% (1/8) of Praomys daltoni, and 1.5\% (1/68) of L. echidnina. We found {DNA} of Wolbachia in X. cheopis from Faladje and {DNA} of Rickettsia africae and Ehrlichia ruminantium in Am. variegatum from Bougouni. The results of our study show that several small mammal species harbor and may serve as potential reservoirs of Bartonella spp., likely to play a major role in the maintenance, circulation, and potential transmission of bacteria in Mali. The pathogenicity of these bacteria for humans or animals remains to be demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Coastal wetlands in Ghana are under severe threat of anthropogenic drivers of habitat degradation and climate change, thereby increasing the need for assessment and monitoring to inform targeted and effective conservation of these ecosystems. Here, we assess small mammal species richness, relative abundance and body mass in three habitats at the Muni-Pomadze Ramsar site of Ghana, and compare these to baseline data gathered in 1997 to evaluate changes in the wetland ecosystem. Small mammals were live-trapped using Sherman collapsible and pitfall traps. We recorded 84 individuals of 10 species in 1485 trap-nights, whereas the baseline study recorded 45 individuals of seven species in 986 trap-nights. The overall trap-success was therefore greater in the present study (5.66 \%) than the baseline study (4.56 \%). The species richness increased from one to four in the forest, and from zero to eight in the thicket, but decreased from six to four in the grassland. The total number of individuals increased in all habitats, with the dominant species in the grassland shifting from Lemniscomys striatus to Mastomys erythroleucus. Three species, Malacomys edwardsi, Grammomys poensis and Praomys tullbergi are the first records for the Muni-Pomadze Ramsar site. Generally, the average body mass of individual species in the grassland was lower in the present study. The considerable changes in small mammal community structure suggest changes in the wetland ecosystem. The conservation implications of our findings are discussed.},

Four localities were sampled, and in each locality, three habitats were surveyed: dense forest, open forest or woodland savannah and shrub savannah. This is the first comprehensive inventory for small mammals in central Benin. We captured 794 small mammals representing twenty species (six shrew species, fourteen rodent species). Three new species that need to be described were recorded. We observed a mixture of both true forest species and of species adapted to a wider range of habitats ranging from savannah to forest clearings. Species with either Sudanian or Guinea-Congolian affinities were recorded, as well as a new species endemic to Togo and Benin. This rich biodiversity underlines the urgent need for an effective protection of these forests. The Sudanian species Crocidura cf. foxi was more abundant in Wari-Maro than in Agoua forest, while the Guineo-Congolian species Praomys misonnei and Hylomyscus sp were only captured in Agoua forest. These results are in agreement with the fact that these two forests belong to two distinct chorological zones.Resume},

The abundance pattern showed a phase of low-to-medium abundances (June 2000-March 2002) leading to a peak (October 2002) followed by a dramatic crash ending in total Population disappearance induced by general flooding of the area in October 2003. Reproduction started well after the end of the rainy season, contrary to observations for this genus elsewhere. Survival was very low between the end of the rainy season and the middle of the dry season, then high during the rest of the dry season. The annual flood of the Niger River was found to have a major influence oil Population and spatial dynamics of M. huberti in this area by eliminating available ground surface in high-flood years, thus causing local extinction, and by delaying the onset of reproduction to the beginning of the dry season. Overall, the dynamics of multimammate rats in the inner delta of the Niger River appeared to be linked to rainfall and flooding patterns in a complex way. Maximum demographic growth appeared to be associated with intermediate levels of flood height, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.},

Bushbuck, in particular, play an important role in certain cultural ceremonies at Muni-Pomadze.

We used reverse transcription {PCR} and resequencing microarrays to detect {LASV} in 41 of 214 samples from rodents captured at 8 locations in Sierra Leone. Phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences of nucleoprotein ({NP}), glycoprotein precursor ({GPC}), and polymerase (L) genes showed 5 separate clades within lineage {IV} of {LASV} in this country. The sequence diversity was higher than previously observed; mean diversity was 7.01\% for nucleoprotein gene at the nucleotide level.

	abstract = {Reproducibility is a key tenet of the scientific process that dictates the reliability and generality of results and methods. The complexities of ecological observations and data present novel challenges in satisfying needs for reproducibility and also transparency. Ecological systems are dynamic and heterogeneous, interacting with numerous factors that sculpt natural history and that investigators cannot completely control. Observations may be highly dependent on spatial and temporal context, making them very difficult to reproduce, but computational reproducibility can still be achieved. Computational reproducibility often refers to the ability to produce equivalent analytical outcomes from the same data set using the same code and software as the original study. When coded workflows are shared, authors and editors provide transparency for readers and allow other researchers to build directly and efficiently on primary work. These qualities may be especially important in ecological applications that have important or controversial implications for science, management, and policy. Expectations for computational reproducibility and transparency are shifting rapidly in the sciences. In this work, we highlight many of the unique challenges for ecology along with practical guidelines for reproducibility and transparency, as ecologists continue to participate in the stewardship of critical environmental information and ensure that research methods demonstrate integrity.},

Usually asymptomatic, toxoplasmosis can be severe and even fatal to many hosts, including people. Elucidating the contribution of genetic variation among parasites to patterns of disease transmission and manifestations has been the goal of many studies. Focusing on the geographic component of this variation, we show that most genotypes are locale-specific, but some are found across continents and are closely related to each other, indicating a recent radiation of a pandemic genotype. Furthermore, we show that the geographic structure of T. gondii is extraordinary in having one population that is found in all continents except South America, whereas other populations are generally confined to South America, and yet another population is found worldwide. Our evidence suggests that South American and Eurasian populations have evolved separately until recently, when ships populated by rats, mice, and cats provided T. gondii with unprecedented migration opportunities, probably during the transatlantic slave trade. Our results explain several enigmatic features of the population structure of T. gondii and demonstrate how pervasive, prompt, and elusive the impact of human globalization is on nature.},

Despite representing a significant public health burden, our understanding of the global distribution of the leishmaniases remains vague, reliant upon expert opinion and limited to poor spatial resolution. A global assessment of the consensus of evidence for leishmaniasis was performed at a sub-national level by aggregating information from a variety of sources. A database of records of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis occurrence was compiled from published literature, online reports, strain archives, and {GenBank} accessions. These, with a suite of biologically relevant environmental covariates, were used in a boosted regression tree modelling framework to generate global environmental risk maps for the leishmaniases. These high-resolution evidence-based maps can help direct future surveillance activities, identify areas to target for disease control and inform future burden estimation efforts.},

	shorttitle = {Global Morbidity and Mortality of Leptospirosis},
	abstract = {Background Leptospirosis, a spirochaetal zoonosis, occurs in diverse epidemiological settings and affects vulnerable populations, such as rural subsistence farmers and urban slum dwellers. Although leptospirosis is a life-threatening disease and recognized as an important cause of pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome, the lack of global estimates for morbidity and mortality has contributed to its neglected disease status. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a systematic review of published morbidity and mortality studies and databases to extract information on disease incidence and case fatality ratios. Linear regression and Monte Carlo modelling were used to obtain age and gender-adjusted estimates of disease morbidity for countries and Global Burden of Disease ({GBD}) and {WHO} regions. We estimated mortality using models that incorporated age and gender-adjusted disease morbidity and case fatality ratios. The review identified 80 studies on disease incidence from 34 countries that met quality criteria. In certain regions, such as Africa, few quality assured studies were identified. The regression model, which incorporated country-specific variables of population structure, life expectancy at birth, distance from the equator, tropical island, and urbanization, accounted for a significant proportion (R2 = 0.60) of the variation in observed disease incidence. We estimate that there were annually 1.03 million cases (95\% {CI} 434,000–1,750,000) and 58,900 deaths (95\% {CI} 23,800–95,900) due to leptospirosis worldwide. A large proportion of cases (48\%, 95\% {CI} 40–61\%) and deaths (42\%, 95\% {CI} 34–53\%) were estimated to occur in adult males with age of 20–49 years. Highest estimates of disease morbidity and mortality were observed in {GBD} regions of South and Southeast Asia, Oceania, Caribbean, Andean, Central, and Tropical Latin America, and East Sub-Saharan Africa. Conclusions/Significance Leptospirosis is among the leading zoonotic causes of morbidity worldwide and accounts for numbers of deaths, which approach or exceed those for other causes of haemorrhagic fever. Highest morbidity and mortality were estimated to occur in resource-poor countries, which include regions where the burden of leptospirosis has been underappreciated.},

	abstract = {Quantifying mammalian biodiversity is a critical yet daunting challenge, particularly in species-rich ecosystems. Non-volant small mammals account for {\textgreater}60\% of the mammalian diversity and often require several survey methods to estimate their species richness and abundance, because of differences in their size and behaviour. Using 117 studies at 278 sites in a species-rich biome, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we determined the influence of trap configuration, trap type, and sampling effort on measures of species richness and abundance. We used generalised linear mixed-effects models to determine which methodological approaches influenced estimates of species richness and abundance at the sampling sites. We used estimates of beta (β) to determine which methods improved species richness and abundance estimates, and generated predicted values for the overall species richness as a function of trap configuration (line transect, grid, or both), trap type (pitfall traps, live-traps or both), and sampling effort (number of trap-nights). Our results indicated that sites in which pitfall traps alone were used generated higher estimates of the overall small mammal species richness and abundance, and rodent abundance, than sites in which only live-traps were used. Sites in which pitfall traps alone were used also produced higher estimates of species richness and abundance, and rodent species richness and abundance, than sites in which both trap types were used. Increased sampling effort led to increased estimates of species richness, but sites in which pitfall traps were used alone or together with live-traps had higher estimates of species richness with less sampling effort than sites in which live-traps only were used. Using pitfall traps greatly reduced the number of trap-nights necessary to obtain a good estimate of small mammal species richness in a community. We found no influence of trap configuration (line transects or grids) on estimates of species richness, but the abundance of rodents was estimated to be higher in sites where both line transects and grids were used, than in sites where only one trap configuration was used. Our review shows the importance of using pitfall traps in research, monitoring, and environmental impact studies on species-rich small mammal communities.},

Five interdisciplinary case studies addressed zoonotic diseases in African settings: Rift Valley fever ({RVF}) in Kenya, human African trypanosomiasis in Zambia and Zimbabwe, Lassa fever in Sierra Leone and henipaviruses in Ghana. Each explored how ecological changes and human–ecosystem interactions affect pathogen dynamics and hence the likelihood of zoonotic spillover and transmission, and how socially differentiated peoples’ interactions with ecosystems and animals affect their exposure to disease. Cross-case analysis highlights how these dynamics vary by ecosystem type, across a range from humid forest to semi-arid savannah; the significance of interacting temporal and spatial scales; and the importance of mosaic and patch dynamics. Ecosystem interactions and services central to different people's livelihoods and well-being include pastoralism and agro-pastoralism, commercial and subsistence crop farming, hunting, collecting food, fuelwood and medicines, and cultural practices. There are synergies, but also tensions and trade-offs, between ecosystem changes that benefit livelihoods and affect disease. Understanding these can inform ‘One Health’ approaches towards managing ecosystems in ways that reduce disease risks and burdens.

We studied the activity and contribution of birds and mammals to intermediate ecosystem services (predation of weed seeds or invertebrate pests) and disservices (predation of crop seeds or beneficial invertebrates) in southern Sweden between June and November 2016. We measured seed and invertebrate predation rates using trays placed in front of 32 wildlife cameras in 16 cereal fields with a local habitat contrast (8 fields adjacent to another crop field and 8 fields adjacent to a semi-natural grassland) and along a landscape heterogeneity gradient (amount of semi-natural grassland). Both activity and predation were dominated by small mammals (mainly rodents), yet only a few species contributed to predation services and disservices according to camera records. Small mammal activity and predation varied considerably over time. Small mammal activity was significantly higher at trays with crop seeds or beneficial invertebrate prey compared to trays with pest prey, and crop seed predation by small mammals was significantly higher than weed seed predation. In contrast, bird activity and predation did not differ significantly between resource types, but varied over time depending on the habitat contrast. Predation of animal prey by birds was highest after cereal harvest, independent of habitat contrast. Our study highlights that birds and in particular rodents provide important intermediate ecosystem services, but also disservices, which fluctuate strongly in intensity over time.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems are multifunctional and provide humanity with a broad array of vital services. Effective management of services requires an improved evidence base, identifying the role of ecosystems in delivering multiple services, which can assist policy-makers in maintaining them. Here, information from the literature and scientific experts was used to systematically document the importance of services and identify trends in their use and status over time for the main terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in Europe. The results from this review show that intensively managed ecosystems contribute mostly to vital provisioning services (e.g. agro-ecosystems provide food via crops and livestock, and forests provide wood), while semi-natural ecosystems (e.g. grasslands and mountains) are key contributors of genetic resources and cultural services (e.g. aesthetic values and sense of place). The most recent European trends in human use of services show increases in demand for crops from agro-ecosystems, timber from forests, water flow regulation from rivers, wetlands and mountains, and recreation and ecotourism in most ecosystems, but decreases in livestock production, freshwater capture fisheries, wild foods and virtually all services associated with ecosystems which have considerably decreased in area (e.g. semi-natural grasslands). The condition of the majority of services show either a degraded or mixed status across Europe with the exception of recent enhancements in timber production in forests and mountains, freshwater provision, water/erosion/natural hazard regulation and recreation/ecotourism in mountains, and climate regulation in forests. Key gaps in knowledge were evident for certain services across all ecosystems, including the provision of biochemicals and natural medicines, genetic resources and the regulating services of seed dispersal, pest/disease regulation and invasion resistance.},

For example, the services of water quality regulation, water flow regulation, mass flow regulation and landscape aesthetics were improved by increases in community and habitat area. Functional traits, such as richness and diversity, also displayed a predominantly positive relationship across the services, most commonly discussed for atmospheric regulation, pest regulation and pollination. A number of studies also discussed a positive correlation with stand age, particularly for atmospheric regulation. Species level traits were found to benefit a number of ecosystem services, with species abundance being particularly important for pest regulation, pollination and recreation, and species richness for timber production and freshwater fishing. Instances of biodiversity negatively affecting the examined ecosystem services were few in number for all ecosystem services, except freshwater provision. The review showed that ecosystem services are generated from numerous interactions occurring in complex systems. However, improving understanding of at least some of the key relationships between biodiversity and service provision will help guide effective management and protection strategies.},

	abstract = {The extent to which the array of land covers dominating anthropogenic landscapes impacts on biodiversity remains today an open question of great relevance. The characteristics of the animal communities inhabiting tropical forest early successional stages can determine, to a large extent, the course of secondary succession and natural regeneration. In this study, we evaluated the response of terrestrial rodents to variations in vegetation and landscape attributes, in early stages of tropical dry forest succession, at three integration levels: (1) communities, (2) populations, and (3) individuals. Our results reveal a rodent response to the variation in vegetation and landscape attributes, which indeed was largely modulated by seasonality, and determined by the focal spatial scale considered. In general, most of the species were favored by vegetation structure simplification and increase in understory density, probably due to the increase in refuge and trophic resources. Nevertheless, one species, Lyomis pictus, was sensitive to variation in vegetation composition and negatively affected by a reduction in vegetation structural complexity, which could be explained by the high number of tree seeds included in their diet. We found a higher diversity of rodents in sites surrounded by a high coverage and connectivity of dry and riparian forest, probably because large forest patches act as sources of species and the forest connectivity favors the colonization process toward sites under regeneration. Our results showed that preserving remnants of the original vegetation and implementing management actions at different spatial scales in anthropogenic landscapes is critical for preventing: (1) an increase in generalist populations, (2) rapid faunal homogenization, (3) defaunation, and (4) the loss of specialist species; with profound implications for the ecology of forest, ecosystem services and human health.},

To investigate the potential of small carnivores for the biological control of rodents within agro-ecosystems, we assessed both the ecological and social landscapes within two rural villages in the Vhembe Biosphere Reserve, South Africa. We employed a camera trapping survey underpinned by an occupancy modelling framework to distinguish between ecological and observation processes affecting small carnivore occupancy. We also used questionnaires to investigate perceptions of small carnivores and their role in pest control. We found the greatest diversity of small carnivores in land used for cropping in comparison to grazing or settlements. Probability of use by small carnivores was influenced negatively by the relative abundance of domestic dogs and positively by the relative abundance of livestock. Greater carnivore diversity and probability of use could be mediated through habitat heterogeneity, food abundance, or reduced competition from domestic carnivores. Village residents failed to appreciate the role of small carnivores in rodent control. Our results suggest that there is significant, although undervalued, potential for small carnivores to provide ecosystem services in agro-ecosystems.},

	abstract = {In agriculture, both valuable ecosystem services and unwanted ecosystem disservices can be produced by the same organism group. For example, small rodents can provide biological control through weed seed consumption but may also act as pests, causing crop damage. We studied the hypothesized causal relationships between ecosystem services (removal of weed seeds) and disservices (removal of wheat grains and crop damage) derived by small rodents (voles and mice) at multiple spatial scales. At the landscape scale, we studied the effects of landscape compositional and configurational heterogeneity on the abundance of voles and mice and their related ecosystem services and disservices along the former inner German border in east and west Germany. At the local scale, we studied how abundance and ecosystem functions are affected by management intensity (organic vs. conventional winter wheat), associated differences in crop characteristics and edge effects. Linear mixed-effects models and path analysis show that voles drove ecosystem disservices, but not ecosystem services, in agricultural fields. Daily wheat seed removal by voles was influenced by increasing wheat height and was almost three times higher than weed seed removal, which was not related to local- or landscape-scale effects. Abundance of voles and associated crop damage decreased with lower crop density and higher wheat height, which were associated with organic farming. Abundance of voles and crop damage were highest in conventional fields in west Germany. Synthesis and applications. As the ecosystem disservice of wheat seed consumption by small rodents must be considered mainly during crop sowing, management before crop harvest should focus on decreasing the pest potential of voles but not mice. Our results suggest that densities of voles and their ecosystem disservices could be reduced by having fields with low crop density and high wheat height, practices associated with organic farming. Surrounding landscapes with low compositional and configurational heterogeneity could further reduce voles’ pest potential, but with probable negative effects on farmland biodiversity.},

One consequence is the proliferation of host–virus association data, which underpin viral macroecology and zoonotic risk prediction but remain fragmented across numerous data portals. In the present article, we propose that synthesis of host–virus data is a central challenge to characterize the global virome and develop foundational theory in viral ecology. To illustrate this, we build an open database of mammal host–virus associations that reconciles four published data sets. We show that this offers a substantially richer view of the known virome than any individual source data set but also that databases such as these risk becoming out of date as viral discovery accelerates. We argue for a shift in practice toward the development, incremental updating, and use of synthetic data sets in viral ecology, to improve replicability and facilitate work to predict the structure and dynamics of the global virome.},

	abstract = {This paper argues that contemporary processes of extended urbanisation, which include suburbanisation, post-suburbanisation and peri-urbanisation, may result in increased vulnerability to infectious disease spread. Through a review of existing literature at the nexus of urbanisation and infectious disease, we consider how this (potential) increased vulnerability to infectious diseases in peri- or suburban areas is in fact dialectically related to socio-material transformations on the metropolitan edge. In particular, we highlight three key factors influencing the spread of infectious disease that have been identified in the literature: demographic change, infrastructure and governance. These have been chosen given both the prominence of these themes and their role in shaping the spread of disease on the urban edge. Further, we suggest how a landscape political ecology framework can be useful for examining the role of socio-ecological transformations in generating increased risk of infectious disease in peri- and suburban areas. To illustrate our arguments we will draw upon examples from various re-emerging infectious disease events and outbreaks around the world to reveal how extended urbanisation in the broadest sense has amplified the conditions necessary for the spread of infectious diseases. We thus call for future research on the spatialities of health and disease to pay attention to how variegated patterns of extended urbanisation may influence possible outbreaks and the mechanisms through which such risks can be alleviated.},

Together, these shortcomings suggest that attempts to assess zoonotic risk using available virological data are likely to be inaccurate and largely only identify those host taxa that have been studied most extensively.

	abstract = {Ebola virus disease ({EVD}) is a complex zoonosis that is highly virulent in humans. The largest recorded outbreak of {EVD} is ongoing in West Africa, outside of its previously reported and predicted niche. We assembled location data on all recorded zoonotic transmission to humans and Ebola virus infection in bats and primates (1976–2014). Using species distribution models, these occurrence data were paired with environmental covariates to predict a zoonotic transmission niche covering 22 countries across Central and West Africa. Vegetation, elevation, temperature, evapotranspiration, and suspected reservoir bat distributions define this relationship. At-risk areas are inhabited by 22 million people; however, the rarity of human outbreaks emphasises the very low probability of transmission to humans. Increasing population sizes and international connectivity by air since the first detection of {EVD} in 1976 suggest that the dynamics of human-to-human secondary transmission in contemporary outbreaks will be very different to those of the past.
          , 
            Since the first outbreaks of Ebola virus disease in 1976, there have been numerous other outbreaks in humans across Africa with fatality rates ranging from 50\% to 90\%. Humans can become infected with the Ebola virus after direct contact with blood or bodily fluids from an infected person or animal. The virus also infects and kills other primates—such as chimpanzees or gorillas—though Old World fruit bats are suspected to be the most likely carriers of the virus in the wild.
            The largest recorded outbreak of Ebola virus disease is ongoing in West Africa: more people have been infected in this current outbreak than in all previous outbreaks combined. The current outbreak is also the first to occur in West Africa—which is outside the previously known range of the Ebola virus.
            Pigott et al. have now updated predictions about where in Africa wild animals may harbour the virus and where the transmission of the virus from these animals to humans is possible. As such, the map identifies the regions that are most at risk of a future Ebola outbreak. The data behind these new maps include the locations of all recorded primary cases of Ebola in human populations—the ‘index’ cases—many of which have been linked to animal sources. The data also include the locations of recorded cases of Ebola virus infections in wild bats and primates from the last forty years. The maps, which were modelled using more flexible methods than previous predictions, also include new information—collected using satellites—about environmental factors and new predictions of the range of wild fruit bats.
            Pigott et al. report that the transmission of Ebola virus from animals to humans is possible in 22 countries across Central and West Africa—and that 22 million people live in the areas at risk. However, outbreaks in human populations are rare and the likelihood of a human getting the disease from an infected animal still remains very low. The updated map does not include data about how infections spread from one person to another, so the next challenge is to use existing data on human-to-human transmission to better understand the likely size and extent of current and future outbreaks. As more people live in, and travel to and from, the at-risk regions than ever before, Pigott et al. note that new outbreaks of Ebola virus disease are likely to be very different to those of the past.},

	abstract = {Land-use change has a direct impact on species survival and reproduction, altering their spatio-temporal distributions. It acts as a selective force that favours the abundance and diversity of reservoir hosts and affects host–pathogen dynamics and prevalence. This has led to land-use change being a significant driver of infectious diseases emergence. Here, we predict the presence of rodent taxa and map the zoonotic hazard (potential sources of harm) from rodent-borne diseases in the short and long term (2025 and 2050). The study considers three different land-use scenarios based on the shared socioeconomic pathways narratives ({SSPs}): sustainable ({SSP}1-Representative Concentration Pathway ({RCP}) 2.6), fossil-fuelled development ({SSP}5-{RCP} 8.5) and deepening inequality ({SSP}4-{RCP} 6.0). We found that cropland expansion into forest and pasture may increase zoonotic hazards in areas with high rodent-species diversity. Nevertheless, a future sustainable scenario may not always reduce hazards. All scenarios presented high heterogeneity in zoonotic hazard, with high-income countries having the lowest hazard range. The {SSPs} narratives suggest that opening borders and reducing cropland expansion are critical to mitigate current and future zoonotic hazards globally, particularly in middle- and low-income economies. Our study advances previous efforts to anticipate the emergence of zoonotic diseases by integrating past, present and future information to guide surveillance and mitigation of zoonotic hazards at the regional and local scale.

Although disease progression is fairly similar for {SARS} and {MERS}, the case fatality rate of {MERS} is much higher than that of {SARS}.Comorbidities have an important role in {SARS} and {MERS}. Several risk factors are associated with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) in {SARS} and {MERS} cases, especially advanced age and male sex. For {MERS}, additional risk factors that are associated with severe disease include chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cancer, renal and lung disease, and co-infections.Although the ancestors of {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} probably circulate in bats, zoonotic transmission of {SARS}-{CoV} required an incidental amplifying host. Dromedary camels are the {MERS}-{CoV} reservoir from which zoonotic transmission occurs; serological evidence indicates that {MERS}-{CoV}-like viruses have been circulating in dromedary camels for at least three decades.Human-to-human transmission of {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} occurs mainly in health care settings. Patients do not shed large amounts of virus until well after the onset of symptoms, when patients are most probably already seeking medical care. Analysis of hospital surfaces after the treatment of patients with {MERS} showed the ubiquitous presence of infectious virus.Our understanding of the pathogenesis of {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} is still incomplete, but the combination of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and an aberrant immune response is thought to have a crucial role in the severity of both syndromes.The severity of the diseases that are caused by emerging coronaviruses highlights the need to develop effective therapeutic measures against these viruses. Although several treatments for {SARS} and {MERS} (based on inhibition of viral replication with drugs or neutralizing antibodies, or on dampening the host response) have been identified in animal models and in vitro studies, efficacy data from human clinical trials are urgently required.},

The hierarchical {GAM} ({HGAM}), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between {HGAMs}, {HGLMs}, and {GAMs}, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how {HGAMs} can be readily fitted using existing {GAM} software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit {HGAMs} on example data.

At the regional level, Eastern Mediterranean had the highest {IgM} seroprevalence (4.1\%, 95\%{CI}: 2.8–5.5) and The Americas, the lowest (1.1\%, 0.8–1.4), with a statistically significant difference between {WHO} regions (p {\textless} 0.0001).

The Ashanti region has recorded the second highest deforestation rates. Despite the government's efforts to maintain and protect Ghana's forest reserves, deforestation continues. We observed deforestation patterns in the Ashanti region of Ghana from 1986 to 2015 using Landsat imagery to identify the main causes of deforestation. We obtained and processed two adjacent Landsat images from the United States Geological Survey's ({USGS}) National Centre for Earth Resources Observation and Science at 30 m spatial resolution for 1986, 2002, and 2015. We then supported the results with findings from 291 farm household surveys in communities fringing the forest reserves. By 2015, dense forest covered 53.3\% of the land area of the forest reserves, and the remaining area had been disturbed. Expansion of annual crop farms and tree crops caused 78\% of the forest loss within the 29-year period. Afforestation projects are ongoing some of which employ the participation of farmers, yet agricultural expansion exerts more pressure on the remaining dense forest. Agricultural intensification on existing farmlands may reduce farm expansion into the remaining forest areas. Strengthening and enforcing forest protection laws could minimise the extent of agricultural encroachment into forests. Mixed tree-crop systems could reduce the effects of arable farming on deforestation, limit the clearance of trees from farmlands, enhance the provision of ecosystem services, and improve the soil's fertility and moisture content. A forest transition may be underway leading to more trees in agricultural systems and better protection of residual natural forests.},

Recent molecular studies have confirmed the fundamental role of the rodent host (Mastomys natalensis) in driving human infections, but control and prevention efforts remain hampered by a limited baseline understanding of the disease’s true incidence, geographical distribution and underlying drivers. Here, we show that Lassa fever occurrence and incidence is influenced by climate, poverty, agriculture and urbanisation factors. However, heterogeneous reporting processes and diagnostic laboratory access also appear to be important drivers of the patchy distribution of observed disease incidence. Using spatiotemporal predictive models we show that including climatic variability added retrospective predictive value over a baseline model (11\% decrease in out-of-sample predictive error). However, predictions for 2020 show that a climate-driven model performs similarly overall to the baseline model. Overall, with ongoing improvements in surveillance there may be potential for forecasting Lassa fever incidence to inform health planning.},

Important factors necessary to understand zoonotic disease ecology include those associated with distribution and population dynamics of reservoir species as well as infection dynamics. Results are based on more than 851,000 trap nights, 16,608 individual deer mice and 10,572 collected blood samples. Deer mice were distributed throughout every habitat we sampled and were present during every sampling period in all habitats except high altitude habitats over 1900 m. Abundance varied greatly among locations with peak numbers occurring mostly during fall. However, peak rodent abundance occurred during fall, winter and spring during various years on three grids trapped 12 months/yr. Prevalence of antibodies to {SNV} averaged 3.9\% to 22.1\% but no grids had mice with antibodies during every month. The maximum period without antibody-positive mice ranged from 1 to 52 months, or even more at high altitude grids where deer mice were not always present. Months without antibody-positive mice were more prevalent during fall than spring. Population fluctuations were not synchronous over broad geographic areas and antibody prevalences were not well spatially consistent, differing greatly over short distances. We observed an apparently negative, but nonstatistically significant relationship between average antibody prevalence and average deer mouse population abundance and a statistically significant positive relationship between the average number of antibody positive mice and average population abundance. We present data from which potential researchers can estimate the effort required to adequately describe the ecology of a rodent-borne viral system. We address different factors affecting population dynamics and hantavirus antibody prevalence and discuss the path to understanding a complex rodent-borne disease system as well as the obstacles in that path.},

Using framing from syndemic theory, we describe how the synzootic concept offers new insights into the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases. We then recommend a set of empirical criteria and lines of evidence that can be used to identify synzootics in nature.

	abstract = {Forecasting the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir populations of wild or domestic animals is essential for the effective deployment of interventions such as wildlife vaccination or culling. Due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust, spatially explicit, predictions is challenging. Recent efforts have begun to make progress in this direction by capitalizing on machine learning methodologies. An important weakness of existing approaches, however, is that they generally rely on combining human and reservoir infection data during the training process and thus conflate risk attributable to the prevalence of the pathogen in the reservoir population with the risk attributed to the realized rate of spillover into the human population. Because effective planning of interventions requires that these components of risk be disentangled, we developed a multi-layer machine learning framework that separates these processes. Our approach begins by training models to predict the geographic range of the primary reservoir and the subset of this range in which the pathogen occurs. The spillover risk predicted by the product of these reservoir specific models is then fit to data on realized patterns of historical spillover into the human population. The result is a geographically specific spillover risk forecast that can be easily decomposed and used to guide effective intervention. Applying our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that regularly spills over into the human population across West Africa, results in a model that explains a modest but statistically significant portion of geographic variation in historical patterns of spillover. When combined with a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics, our spillover risk model predicts that 897,700 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year across West Africa, with Nigeria accounting for more than half of these human infections.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasmosis is one of the most prevalent infections in humans and animals caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). Rodents, as intermediate and reservoir hosts, play a key role in the maintenance and transmission of T. gondii. They can be contaminated and maintain the parasite in the form of cysts in their bodies, demonstrating an infection source for their offsprings, predators (particularly felids), and other animals. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis study was carried out to evaluate the global seroprevalence of T. gondii in these mammals. For achieving the purpose of the current study, six English databases ({PubMed}, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, {ProQuest}, and Google Scholar) were systematically searched for related studies from 1970 to 2018. Finally, a total of 52,372 records were screened, 105 records including 26,221 rodents were incorporated in the present study. By random effect models, the overall seroprevalence was calculated at 6\% (95\% {CI} = 6–7\%), with the highest amount was observed in Africa (24\%) and South America (18\%), and the lowest amount in Europe (1\%). The subgroup data analysis by gender manifested that the prevalence of Immunoglobulin G antibodies did not differ between genders (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Due to the significant heterogeneity, meta-regression models were applied based on serological techniques and continental regions; however, the obtained values were not statistically significant (P = 0.480 and P = 0.295, respectively). The present study revealed a relatively low level of T. gondii seroprevalence in rodents; however, if they were the main food source for their predators, they would cause high transmission of T. gondii.},

	abstract = {Host-virus association data underpin research into the distribution and eco-evolutionary correlates of viral diversity and zoonotic risk across host species. However, current knowledge of the wildlife virome is inherently constrained by historical discovery effort, and there are concerns that the reliability of ecological inference from host-virus data may be undermined by taxonomic and geographical sampling biases. Here, we evaluate whether current estimates of host-level viral diversity in wild mammals are stable enough to be considered biologically meaningful, by analysing a comprehensive dataset of discovery dates of 6571 unique mammal host-virus associations between 1930 and 2018. We show that virus discovery rates in mammal hosts are either constant or accelerating, with little evidence of declines towards viral richness asymptotes, even in highly sampled hosts. Consequently, inference of relative viral richness across host species has been unstable over time, particularly in bats, where intensified surveillance since the early 2000s caused a rapid rearrangement of species' ranked viral richness. Our results illustrate that comparative inference of host-level virus diversity across mammals is highly sensitive to even short-term changes in sampling effort. We advise caution to avoid overinterpreting patterns in current data, since it is feasible that an analysis conducted today could draw quite different conclusions than one conducted only a decade ago.},

	abstract = {Species distribution modeling, in combination with databases of specimen distribution records, is advocated as a solution to the problem of distributional data limitation in biogeography and ecology. The global biodiversity information facility ({GBIF}), a portal that collates digitized collection and survey data, is the largest online provider of distribution records. However, all distributional databases are spatially biassed due to uneven effort of sampling, data storage and mobilization. Such bias is particularly pronounced in {GBIF}, where nation-wide differences in funding and data sharing lead to huge differences in contribution to {GBIF}. We use a common Eurasian butterfly (Aglais urticae) as an exemplar taxon to provide evidence that range model quality is decreasing due to the spatial clustering of distributional records in {GBIF}. Furthermore, we show that such loss of model quality would go unnoticed with standard methods of model quality evaluation. Using evaluations of model predictions of the Swiss distribution of the species, we compare distribution models of full data with data where a subsampling procedure removes spatial bias at the cost of record numbers, but not of spatial extent of records. We show that data with less spatial bias produce better predictive models even though they are based on less input data. Our subsampling routine may therefore be a suitable method to reduce the impact of spatial bias to species distribution models. Our results warn of automatized applications of species distribution models to distributional databases (as has been advocated and implemented), as internal model evaluation did not show the decline of model quality with increased spatial bias (but rather the opposite) while expert evaluation clearly did.},

Prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens are represented in almost equal numbers. Host species consist of approximately 60\% plants (split 50:50 between cereal and non-cereal plants), and 40\% other species of medical and/or environmental importance. The information available on pathogen effectors has risen by more than a third, and the entries for pathogens that infect crop species of global importance has dramatically increased in this release.

        Recent findings 
        The majority of emerging infectious disease events over recent decades, including the {COVID}-19 pandemic, have been caused by zoonotic viruses and bacteria. In particular, coronaviruses, haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses and influenza A viruses have caused significant epidemics globally. There have been recent advances in understanding the origins and drivers of zoonotic epidemics, yet there are gaps in diagnostic capacity and clinical training about zoonoses.
        Summary 
        Identifying the origins of zoonotic pathogens, understanding factors influencing disease transmission and improving the diagnostic capacity of clinicians will be crucial to early detection and prevention of further epidemics of zoonoses.},

This is, in part, a consequence of under-reporting, resulting in underestimation of their global burden, which in turn artificially downgrades their importance in the eyes of administrators and funding agencies. The development of cheap and effective vaccines is no guarantee that these endemic diseases will be eliminated in the near future. However, simply increasing awareness about their causes and how they may be prevented—often with very simple technologies—could reduce the incidence of many endemic zoonoses. Sustainable control of zoonoses is reliant on surveillance, but, as with other public-sector animal health services, this is rarely implemented in the developing world, not least because of the lack of sufficiently cheap diagnostics. Public–private partnerships have already provided advocacy for human disease control and could be equally effective in addressing endemic zoonoses.},

We aim to resolve these outstanding issues by (a) highlighting similarities among seven presence–absence {JSDMs} using a clearly defined, singular notation; and (b) evaluating the computational and statistical performance of each {JSDM} using six datasets that vary widely in numbers of sites, species, and environmental covariates considered. Our singular notation shows that many of the {JSDMs} are very similar, and in turn parameter estimates of different {JSDMs} are moderate to strongly, positively correlated. In contrast, the different {JSDMs} clearly differ in computational efficiency and memory limitations. Our framework will allow ecologists to make educated decisions about the {JSDM} that best suits their objective, and enable wider uptake of {JSDM} methods among the ecological community.},

Cases of human monkeypox are rarely seen outside of west and central Africa. There are few data regarding viral kinetics or the duration of viral shedding and no licensed treatments. Two oral drugs, brincidofovir and tecovirimat, have been approved for treatment of smallpox and have demonstrated efficacy against monkeypox in animals. Our aim was to describe the longitudinal clinical course of monkeypox in a high-income setting, coupled with viral dynamics, and any adverse events related to novel antiviral therapies.
Methods
In this retrospective observational study, we report the clinical features, longitudinal virological findings, and response to off-label antivirals in seven patients with monkeypox who were diagnosed in the {UK} between 2018 and 2021, identified through retrospective case-note review. This study included all patients who were managed in dedicated high consequence infectious diseases ({HCID}) centres in Liverpool, London, and Newcastle, coordinated via a national {HCID} network.
Findings
We reviewed all cases since the inception of the {HCID} (airborne) network between Aug 15, 2018, and Sept 10, 2021, identifying seven patients. Of the seven patients, four were men and three were women. Three acquired monkeypox in the {UK}: one patient was a health-care worker who acquired the virus nosocomially, and one patient who acquired the virus abroad transmitted it to an adult and child within their household cluster. Notable disease features included viraemia, prolonged monkeypox virus {DNA} detection in upper respiratory tract swabs, reactive low mood, and one patient had a monkeypox virus {PCR}-positive deep tissue abscess. Five patients spent more than 3 weeks (range 22–39 days) in isolation due to prolonged {PCR} positivity. Three patients were treated with brincidofovir (200 mg once a week orally), all of whom developed elevated liver enzymes resulting in cessation of therapy. One patient was treated with tecovirimat (600 mg twice daily for 2 weeks orally), experienced no adverse effects, and had a shorter duration of viral shedding and illness (10 days hospitalisation) compared with the other six patients. One patient experienced a mild relapse 6 weeks after hospital discharge.
Interpretation
Human monkeypox poses unique challenges, even to well resourced health-care systems with {HCID} networks. Prolonged upper respiratory tract viral {DNA} shedding after skin lesion resolution challenged current infection prevention and control guidance. There is an urgent need for prospective studies of antivirals for this disease.

However, spatially explicit and thematically detailed quantitative analyses of land cover change over long time periods and at regional scale have been lacking. Here we present a change intensity analysis of a Landsat-based, visually interpreted, multi-date (1975, 2000, 2013) land cover dataset of West Africa, stratified into five bioclimatic sub-regions. Change intensities accelerated over time and increased from the arid to the sub-humid sub-regions, as did population densities. The area occupied by human-dominated land cover categories more than doubled from 493,000 km2 in 1975 to 1,121,000 km2 in 2013. Land cover change intensities within 10 km of new settlement locations exceeded the region-wide average by up to a factor of three, substantiating the significant role of population pressure as a force of change. The spatial patterns of the human footprint in West Africa, however, suggest that not only population pressure but also changing socioeconomic conditions and policies shape the complexity of land cover outcomes.},

	abstract = {The {COVID}-19 pandemic has given the study of virus evolution and ecology new relevance. Although viruses were first identified more than a century ago, we likely know less about their diversity than that of any other biological entity. Most documented animal viruses have been sampled from just two phyla — the Chordata and the Arthropoda — with a strong bias towards viruses that infect humans or animals of economic and social importance, often in association with strong disease phenotypes. Fortunately, the recent development of unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing is providing a richer view of the animal virome and shedding new light on virus evolution. In this Review, we explore our changing understanding of the diversity, composition and evolution of the animal virome. We outline the factors that determine the phylogenetic diversity and genomic structure of animal viruses on evolutionary timescales and show how this impacts assessment of the risk of disease emergence in the short term. We also describe the ongoing challenges in metagenomic analysis and outline key themes for future research. A central question is how major events in the evolutionary history of animals, such as the origin of the vertebrates and periodic mass extinction events, have shaped the diversity and evolution of the viruses they carry.},

Third, what role does host species diversity play in maintaining pathogen persistence?

A Disease Reference Group on Zoonoses and Marginalised Infectious Diseases ({DRG}6) was convened by the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases ({TDR}), a programme executed by the World Health Organization and co-sponsored by {UNICEF}, {UNDP}, the World Bank and {WHO}. The key considerations included: (a) the general lack of reliable quantitative data on their public health burden; (b) the need to evaluate livestock production losses and their additional impacts on health and poverty; (c) the relevance of cross-sectoral issues essential to designing and implementing public health interventions for zoonotic diseases; and (d) identifying priority areas for research and interventions to harness resources most effectively. Beyond disease specific research issues, a set of common macro-priorities and interventions were identified which, if implemented through a more integrated approach by countries, would have a significant impact on human health of the most marginalised populations characteristically dependent on livestock.},

	shorttitle = {Invasive species distribution modeling ({iSDM})},
	abstract = {Species distribution models ({SDMs}) based on statistical relationships between occurrence data and underlying environmental conditions are increasingly used to predict spatial patterns of biological invasions and prioritize locations for early detection and control of invasion outbreaks. However, invasive species distribution models ({iSDMs}) face special challenges because (i) they typically violate {SDM}'s assumption that the organism is in equilibrium with its environment, and (ii) species absence data are often unavailable or believed to be too difficult to interpret. This often leads researchers to generate pseudo-absences for model training or utilize presence-only methods, and to confuse the distinction between predictions of potential vs. actual distribution. We examined the hypothesis that true-absence data, when accompanied by dispersal constraints, improve prediction accuracy and ecological understanding of {iSDMs} that aim to predict the actual distribution of biological invasions. We evaluated the impact of presence-only, true-absence and pseudo-absence data on model accuracy using an extensive dataset on the distribution of the invasive forest pathogen Phytophthora ramorum in California. Two traditional presence/absence models (generalized linear model and classification trees) and two alternative presence-only models (ecological niche factor analysis and maximum entropy) were developed based on 890 field plots of pathogen occurrence and several climatic, topographic, host vegetation and dispersal variables. The effects of all three possible types of occurrence data on model performance were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) and omission/commission error rates. Results show that prediction of actual distribution was less accurate when we ignored true-absences and dispersal constraints. Presence-only models and models without dispersal information tended to over-predict the actual range of invasions. Models based on pseudo-absence data exhibited similar accuracies as presence-only models but produced spatially less feasible predictions. We suggest that true-absence data are a critical ingredient not only for accurate calibration but also for ecologically meaningful assessment of {iSDMs} that focus on predictions of actual distributions.},

	abstract = {Large-scale biodiversity databases have great potential for quantifying long-term trends of species, but they also bring many methodological challenges. Spatial bias of species occurrence records is well recognized. Yet, the dynamic nature of this spatial bias – how spatial bias has changed over time – has been largely overlooked. We examined the spatial bias of species occurrence records within multiple biodiversity databases in Germany and tested whether spatial bias in relation to land cover or land use (urban and protected areas) has changed over time. We focused our analyses on urban and protected areas as these represent two well-known correlates of sampling bias in biodiversity datasets. We found that the proportion of annual records from urban areas has increased over time while the proportion of annual records within protected areas has not consistently changed. Using simulations, we examined the implications of this changing sampling bias for estimation of long-term trends of species' distributions. When assessing biodiversity change, our findings suggest that the effects of spatial bias depend on how it affects sampling of the underlying land-use change drivers affecting species. Oversampling of regions undergoing the greatest degree of change, for instance near human settlements, might lead to overestimation of the trends of specialist species. For robust estimation of the long-term trends in species' distributions, analyses using species occurrence records may need to consider not only spatial bias, but also changes in the spatial bias through time.},

Although there are published maps for many emerging zoonotic viruses, it is unknown if there is agreement among different models or if they are concordant with national expert opinion. Therefore, we reviewed existing predictions for five high priority emerging zoonotic viruses with national experts in Cameroon to investigate these issues and determine how to make predictions more useful for national policymakers. Predictive maps relied primarily on environmental parameters and species distribution models. Rift Valley fever virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus predictions differed from national expert opinion, potentially because of local livestock movements. Our findings reveal that involving national experts could elicit additional data to improve predictions of emerging pathogens as well as help repackage predictions for policymakers.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic illness responsible for disease outbreaks across West Africa. It is a zoonosis, with the primary reservoir species identified as the Natal multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis. The host is distributed across sub-Saharan Africa while the virus' range appears to be restricted to West Africa. The majority of infections result from interactions between the animal reservoir and human populations, although secondary transmission between humans can occur, particularly in hospital settings.
{METHODS}: Using a species distribution model, the locations of confirmed human and animal infections with Lassa virus ({LASV}) were used to generate a probabilistic surface of zoonotic transmission potential across sub-Saharan Africa.
{RESULTS}: Our results predict that 37.7 million people in 14 countries, across much of West Africa, live in areas where conditions are suitable for zoonotic transmission of {LASV}. Four of these countries, where at-risk populations are predicted, have yet to report any cases of Lassa fever.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These maps act as a spatial guide for future surveillance activities to better characterise the geographical distribution of the disease and understand the anthropological, virological and zoological interactions necessary for viral transmission. Combining this zoonotic niche map with detailed patient travel histories can aid differential diagnoses of febrile illnesses, enabling a more rapid response in providing care and reducing the risk of onward transmission.},

	abstract = {Based on empiric surveillance data, the incidence of human Lassa fever ({LF}) cases in Guinea and other West African countries has been reported to increase during the dry season compared to the rainy season. To investigate possible links with the ecology of the rodent reservoir of the virus, we conducted a 2-year longitudinal survey of Mastomys natalensis in a region of high human Lassa virus ({LASV}) seropositivity in Guinea. Standardized rodent trapping with similar trapping efforts between seasons was performed in three villages and 53.5\% (601/1123) of the animals were identified as M. natalensis using morphometric and molecular criteria. Mean trapping success ({TS}) of M. natalensis was always higher inside houses than in proximal cultivations. In the dry season, mean {TS} increased 2-fold inside houses and decreased up to 10-fold outside (p {\textless} 0.0001), suggesting aggregation of rodents inside houses due to restricted food supply. 14.5\% (80/553) of M. natalensis were tested positive for Lassa virus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}; range, 5\%-30\%) and prevalence of the virus was two to three times higher in rodents captured in the rainy season than in the dry season (p {\textless} 0.05). Inside houses, however, the {LASV} prevalence fluctuated nonsignificantly with season. These data suggest that in Guinea the risk of {LASV} transmission from rodents to humans is present both in the rainy and the dry season, reflected by the occurrence of {LF} cases throughout the year. In the dry season, however, the increased risk of humans encountering Mastomys and their excreta inside of houses may result in an increase of human Lassa fever cases.},

	abstract = {Background Lassa fever is caused by a viral haemorrhagic arenavirus that affects two to three million people in West Africa, causing a mortality of between 5,000 and 10,000 each year. The natural reservoir of Lassa virus is the multi-mammate rat Mastomys natalensis, which lives in houses and surrounding fields. With the aim of gaining more information to control this disease, we here carry out a spatial analysis of Lassa fever data from human cases and infected rodent hosts covering the period 1965–2007. Information on contemporary environmental conditions (temperature, rainfall, vegetation) was derived from {NASA} Terra {MODIS} satellite sensor data and other sources and for elevation from the {GTOPO}30 surface for the region from Senegal to the Congo. All multi-temporal data were analysed using temporal Fourier techniques to generate images of means, amplitudes and phases which were used as the predictor variables in the models. In addition, meteorological rainfall data collected between 1951 and 1989 were used to generate a synoptic rainfall surface for the same region. Methodology/Principal Findings Three different analyses (models) are presented, one superimposing Lassa fever outbreaks on the mean rainfall surface (Model 1) and the other two using non-linear discriminant analytical techniques. Model 2 selected variables in a step-wise inclusive fashion, and Model 3 used an information-theoretic approach in which many different random combinations of 10 variables were fitted to the Lassa fever data. Three combinations of absence∶presence clusters were used in each of Models 2 and 3, the 2 absence∶1 presence cluster combination giving what appeared to be the best result. Model 1 showed that the recorded outbreaks of Lassa fever in human populations occurred in zones receiving between 1,500 and 3,000 mm rainfall annually. Rainfall, and to a much lesser extent temperature variables, were most strongly selected in both Models 2 and 3, and neither vegetation nor altitude seemed particularly important. Both Models 2 and 3 produced mean kappa values in excess of 0.91 (Model 2) or 0.86 (Model 3), making them ‘Excellent’. Conclusion/Significance The Lassa fever areas predicted by the models cover approximately 80\% of each of Sierra Leone and Liberia, 50\% of Guinea, 40\% of Nigeria, 30\% of each of Côte d'Ivoire, Togo and Benin, and 10\% of Ghana.},

	abstract = {Environmental changes have been shown to play an important role in the emergence of new human diseases of zoonotic origin. The contribution of social factors to their spread, especially conflicts followed by mass movement of populations, has not been extensively investigated. Here we reveal the effects of civil war on the phylogeography of a zoonotic emerging infectious disease by concomitantly studying the population structure, evolution and demography of Lassa virus and its natural reservoir, the rodent Mastomys natalensis, in Guinea, West Africa. Analysis of nucleoprotein gene sequences enabled us to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Lassa virus, which appeared 750 to 900 years ago in Nigeria and only recently spread across western Africa (170 years ago). Bayesian demographic inferences revealed that both the host and the virus populations have gone recently through severe genetic bottlenecks. The timing of these events matches civil war-related mass movements of refugees and accompanying environmental degradation. Forest and habitat destruction and human predation of the natural reservoir are likely explanations for the sharp decline observed in the rodent populations, the consequent virus population decline, and the coincident increased incidence of Lassa fever in these regions. Interestingly, we were also able to detect a similar pattern in Nigeria coinciding with the Biafra war. Our findings show that anthropogenic factors may profoundly impact the population genetics of a virus and its reservoir within the context of an emerging infectious disease.},

We sought to elucidate the diversity and distribution of these animals (including known {LASV} reservoirs) geographically, habitat-wise and seasonally. Our {DNA}-assisted survey detected at least 19 small mammal species amongst 790 specimens. Diversity indices were similar between ecological zones and also between endemic and non-endemic areas for Lassa fever. Mastomys natalensis, the most renowned {LASV} host, was present in eight out of nine localities sampled. We also described the spatial occurrence of other known {LASV} hosts such as M. erythroleucus and Hylomyscus pamfi, including carriers of {LASV}-like arenaviruses such as Mus (Nannomys) spp. The most numerous rodents (Mastomys natalensis, M. erythroleucus, and Praomys daltoni) were captured mainly inside human dwellings. Reproductive activity occurred throughout the year, but led to population peaks for M. natalensis in the dry season and for M. erythroleucus and P. daltoni in the rainy season. Extensive geographic distribution of {LASV} rodent reservoirs, with population peaks in different seasons, shows that the risk of rodent-to-human transmission of {LASV} is greater than currently realized.},

	abstract = {Human infectious diseases are a significant threat to global human health and economies (e.g. Ebola, {SARs}), with the majority of infectious diseases having an animal source (zoonotic). Despite their importance, the lack of a quantitative predictive framework hampers our understanding of how spillovers of zoonotic infectious diseases into the human population will be impacted by global environmental stressors. Here, we create an environmental-mechanistic model for understanding the impact of global change on the probability of zoonotic disease reservoir host–human spillover events. As a case study, we focus on Lassa fever virus ({LAS}). We first quantify the spatial determinants of {LAS} outbreaks, including the phylogeographic distribution of its reservoir host Natal multimammate rat (Mastomys natalensis) ({LAS} host). Secondly, we use these determinants to inform our environmental-mechanistic model to estimate present-day {LAS} spillover events and the predicted impact of climate change, human population growth and land use by 2070. We find phylogeographic evidence to suggest that {LAS} is confined to only one clade of {LAS} host (Western clade Mastomys natalensis) and that the probability of its occurrence was a major determinant of the spatial variation in {LAS} historical outbreaks (69·8\%), along with human population density (20·4\%). Our estimates for present-day {LAS} spillover events from our environmental-mechanistic model were consistent with observed patterns, and we predict an increase in events per year by 2070 from 195 125 to 406 725 within the {LAS} endemic western African region. Of the component drivers, climate change and human population growth are predicted to have the largest effects by increasing landscape suitability for the host and human–host contact rates, while land-use change has only a weak impact on the number of future events. {LAS} spillover events did not respond uniformly to global environmental stressors, and we suggest that understanding the impact of global change on zoonotic infectious disease emergence requires an understanding of how reservoir host species respond to environmental change. Our environmental-mechanistic modelling methodology provides a novel generalizable framework to understand the impact of global change on the spillover of zoonotic diseases.},

	shorttitle = {Chapter 5 - Lassa Fever},
	abstract = {Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever, caused by an arenavirus discovered in 1969 in Nigeria. Nosocomial outbreaks and high seroprevalences have been recorded in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. After 7–10 days of incubation, humans develop fever, malaise, headache, myalgias and sore throat, although most have no recognized symptoms. Acute cases with diarrhea, edema and bleeding from mucosal surfaces affect 0.5\% of the human population, with death occurring 10–15 days after onset. The disease has two geographically endemic areas separated by 2000 km with little evidence of virus circulation in Benin, Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire and Mali. The reservoir is the multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, a rodent widely distributed in Africa. In West Africa, this species is mainly commensal, with populations fluctuating over time and space in rural localities. They are more abundant inside human habitation during the dry season than during the rainy season, increasing the risk of transmission to humans in the dry season. People living in villages are infected by contact with rodent excreta, or by inhaling viral particles. There is also evidence of human-to-human transmission in rural and urban localities. A human-to-rodent transmission is also discussed in this chapter as a consequence of the virus excretion in human saliva and urine, and the virus surviving outside the host. The genome of Lassa virus is bisegmented, with a small fragment coding for the glycoprotein and the nucleoprotein, and a long segment coding for the polymerase and the matrix protein. Today, 11 strains are completely sequenced, and phylogenies reveal large virus diversity in Nigeria with three lineages, while only one exists in Sierra Leone-Guinea-Liberia. Another lineage from Ghana-Côte d’Ivoire-Mali would be intermediate. The phylogeny reveals that Lassa virus emerged 700–900 years ago in Nigeria and then in Sierra Leone 150–200 years ago. This time scale does not support the co-evolution concept since M. natalensis emerged 2.3 million years ago. Recent findings such as new arenaviruses in other African rodents and in snakes argue preferably toward the host-switching concept. The recent emergence in Sierra Leone, the absence of virus positive Mastomys between the two endemic zones and poor virus diversity in the Mano River area point in the direction of a unique import of Lassa virus from Nigeria to Sierra Leone during the 19th century. The hypothesis of human displacements through the Atlantic slave trade and its abolition in 1807 concludes this chapter.},

	abstract = {Understanding the effects of land-use change on zoonotic disease risk is a pressing global health concern. Here, we compare prevalence of Yersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague, in rodents across two land-use types—agricultural and conserved—in northern Tanzania. Estimated abundance of seropositive rodents nearly doubled in agricultural sites compared with conserved sites. This relationship between land-use type and abundance of seropositive rodents is likely mediated by changes in rodent and flea community composition, particularly via an increase in the abundance of the commensal species, Mastomys natalensis, in agricultural habitats. There was mixed support for rodent species diversity negatively impacting Y. pestis seroprevalence. Together, these results suggest that land-use change could affect the risk of local transmission of plague, and raise critical questions about transmission dynamics at the interface of conserved and agricultural habitats. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding disease ecology in the context of rapidly proceeding landscape change.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}. The influence of the intensity of land use on small mammals in the ecoregion Nama Karoo, Namibia was investigated within the biodiversity programme {BIOTA}. Changes in species diversity and abundance were investigated across a fence separating heavily grazed communal and lightly grazed government owned rangeland. Assessing and monitoring of the small mammal populations were done seasonally from 2001-2003 on each of 2ha plots by using capture-mark-recapture methods. In total, 311 individuals representing nine species were caught within 5760 trap nights. Species richness, total abundance, species diversity and settlement was lower in the over-grazed area. The most abundant species were the Gerbillinae, Gerbillurus vallinus and Tatera leucogaster. T. leu-cogaster did not occur in the overgrazed area. Due to the loss of grass cover, smaller bush diversity, bush encroach-ment and smaller arthropod abundance in the overgrazed area, changes in the small mammal community were most likely caused by the loss of food resources, available dew, disruption of habitat structures, cover and shelter and by increased predation risk. Only the ‘desert ’ species, G. vallinus, was favoured by the degraded land. It is also obvious that the uncontrolled grazing in the communal lands has affected the biodiversity and the regeneration potential, thus leading to land degradation.},

A total of 1,030 rodents belonging to 14 species were captured on 10,584 trap nights. Rodent species recorded include: Lophuromys stanleyi, Hylomyscus stella, Praomys jacksoni, Mastomys natalensis, Lophuromys ansorgei, Lemniscomys striatus, Aethomys hindei, Mus triton, Mus minutoides, Deomys ferrugineus, Gerbilliscus kempi, Rattus rattus, Grammomys kuru, and Hybomys univittatus. Overall, L. stanleyi (23.7\%) was the most dominant species followed by H. stella, P. jacksoni, and M. natalensis. Species richness and evenness was highest in the regenerating forest habitat and least in the intact forest habitat. Rodent abundance was significantly affected by habitat type. The regenerating forest habitat had the highest number of animals, while the lowest numbers were observed in the depleted forest habitat. Species diversity was higher in regenerating forest habitat and lowest in the intact forest. The three habitats appeared distinct in terms of rodent species composition and there was a strong association between the two trapping grids in the same habitat type. All ordination plots showed that different rodent species consistently associated with distinct habitats. Habitat type and seasonal changes influenced rodent composition, relative abundance and habitat association. Composition of rodent community reflected the level of habitat degradation and can be used as a proxy for evaluating the biodiversity of lowland tropical forests.},

	abstract = {The fluctuations in abundance of a wildlife reservoir are an attractive explanation for temporal variation in primary human cases of a zoonosis. This is because high abundance may lead to more contact between humans and animals, but also to outbreaks of disease within the reservoir population. We propose a mathematical framework that sets out the consequences of correlation between reservoir abundance and reservoir prevalence for how numbers of human cases are related to reservoir abundance. The fluctuations of rodent populations are well studied and often dramatic. A review of field studies of rodent reservoirs for plague, hantaviruses, and other zoonoses shows that, at a seasonal time scale, a positive correlation between host abundance and host prevalence is rarely observed. More commonly, there is an inverse relationship or negative correlation such that a seasonal increase in rodent abundance is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the abundance of infectious animals. Seasonal changes in rodent abundance are hence unlikely to fully explain seasonal variation in primary human cases. The few longer field studies (Ͼ5 years) show a positive but delayed relationship between reservoir abundance and reservoir prevalence. Key Words: Force of infection—Hantavirus—Plague.

	abstract = {As Lassa fever continues to be a public health challenge in West Africa, it is critical to produce good maps of its risk pattern for use in active surveillance and control intervention. We identified eight spatial features related to the rubber plantation environment and used them as explanatory variables for Lassa fever ({LF}) outbreaks on the Uniroyal Liberian Agricultural Company ({LAC}) rubber plantation environment in Grand Bassa County, Liberia. We computed classical and spatial lag regression models on all spatial features, including proximity of residential camp to rubber tree-edge, main road in the plantation, {LAC} hospital, rice farmland, household refuse dump, human population density, post-harvest storage density of rice and density of rodent deterrent on rice storage. We found significant (p=0.0024) spatial autocorrelation between {LF} cases and the spatial features we have considered. We concluded that the rubber plantation environment influenced Mastomys species' breeding and transmission of Lassa virus along spatial scale to humans. The risk factors identified in this study offered a baseline for more effective surveillance and control of {LF} in the post-civil conflict Liberia. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Often overshadowed by global trends in urbanization, counter-urbanization is also on the rise worldwide. Left unaddressed, counter-urbanization can result in conditions that imperil human well-being. For example, counter-urbanization is hypothesized to increase the prevalence of ecological hazards like synanthropic pest and pathogen host species by shifting habitat and resource availability. In this study, we addressed this hypothesis by examining whether the abundance or diversity of rodent hosts varies according to the prevalence of abandoned, unmaintained properties across a mosaic of counter-urbanization in post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans (Louisiana, {USA}). We also sought to determine whether management of vacant lots can influence the abundance or diversity of rodents across counter-urbanizing landscapes. Analysis of capture data from multi-year trapping efforts across the greater New Orleans area showed that total rodent abundance was highest in residential areas with high levels of vacancy and unmaintained vegetation as well as low household income and low residency. Greater rodent abundance and richness also occurred in areas with features related to infrastructure loss, such as trash and debris, especially in winter. While these results highlight that property abandonment can augment populations of pest and pathogen host species, our findings also indicate that management of abandoned areas can potentially mitigate public health concerns in counter-urbanizing landscapes.},

	abstract = {Improving detection probabilities for rare species is critical when assessing presence or habitat associations. Our goal was to create a new small mammal trapping protocol that improved detection of rare species, such as the olive-backed pocket mouse (Perognathus fasciatus). We used three trap and bait types and trapped an area 4.4 times larger than the standard grid. We also assessed the effect of captures of non-target species on detection probability of pocket mice. Regardless of species, trap success was higher for Havaharts. We found that bait and trap type selection varied significantly by species, with pocket mice showing strongest selection for Havahart traps baited with bird seed. Increasing grid size, while maintaining a similar trapping effort, resulted in higher detection probability, although our analyses showed that effective grids can be about three-quarters of the size we use to achieve similar results. We were also able to demonstrate that by deploying a combination of different traps and baits it is possible to overcome the potential effect of non-target species (e.g., deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus) on the detection probability of pocket mice. Our results show that simple changes to standard small-mammal trapping methods can dramatically increase the detectability of rare and elusive small mammals. Increasing detection probability of rare components of a community can improve the results and understanding of future studies.},

The key feature of such problems, which we exploit, is that variation in abundance induces variation in detection probability. Thus, heterogeneity in abundance can be modeled as heterogeneity in detection probability. Moreover, this linkage between heterogeneity in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability allows one to exploit a heterogeneous detection probability model to estimate the underlying distribution of abundances. Therefore, our method allows estimation of abundance from repeated observations of the presence or absence of animals without having to uniquely mark individuals in the population.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus ({LASV}). It is a deadly rodent-borne zoonosis with outbreaks occurring mostly in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria, in West Africa. In Sierra Leone, surveillance activities of {LASV} focus mainly on the Kenema area in the eastern region, known to be the epicentre. Little is known about the presence of the virus in the Bo area, where Mastomys natalensis and Rattus rattus share habitats with humans. Our study investigated the circulation and phylogeny of new {LASV} strains and virus seroprevalence in rodent populations of villages in Bo district. Information provided here will be of great importance in prioritizing areas for Lassa fever surveillance and preventive measures to mitigate future outbreaks. Our rodent longitudinal survey carried out over two years (2014-2016) identified Mastomys natalensis as the most prevalent species. While seropositive small mammals were found in every village, the four Mastomys natalensis rodents that tested {PCR}-positive for Lassa virus were found in only two villages. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these sequences belong to the Sierra Leonean clade, within lineage {IV}. In conclusion, {LASV} is present, with low circulation, in small mammals in rural settings around Bo. Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus {LASV}, which was first isolated in the rodent Mastomys natalensis in 1974 in Kenema, Sierra Leone. As little is known about the abundance and the presence of {LASV} in rodents living in the Bo area, we carried out a small mammal longitudinal population survey. A standardized trapping session was performed in various habitats and seasons in six villages over two years (2014-2016) and samples collected were tested for arenavirus {IgG} and {LASV}. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed on sequences identified by {PCR}. A total of 1490 small mammals were collected, and 16 rodent species were identified, with M. natalensis (355, 24\%) found to be the most prevalent species. Forty-one (2.8\%) samples were {IgG} positive, and 31 of these were trapped in homes and 10 in surrounding vegetation. Twenty-nine of 41 seropositive rodents were M. natalensis. We detected four {LASV} by {PCR} in two villages, all found in M. natalensis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences were distributed within the Sierra Leonean clade within lineage {IV}, distinguishing a Bo sub-clade older than a Kenema sub-clade. Compared to other settings, we found a low abundance of M. natalensis and a low circulation of {LASV} in rodents in villages around Bo district.},

We independently validated the map using occurrence data for 828 species of vertebrates (35152 point plus 8181 polygonal occurrences) and 6026 sampling sites. Across datasets and mapped classes we found on average a balanced accuracy of 0.77 (\$\${\textbackslash}bar\{+\}\$\$0.14 {SD}) at Level 1 and 0.71 (\$\${\textbackslash}bar\{+\}\$\$0.15 {SD}) at Level 2, while noting potential issues of using occurrence records for validation.

Camera trapping is a widely employed tool in wildlife research, used to estimate animal abundances, understand animal movement, assess species richness and understand animal behaviour. In addition to images of wild animals, research cameras often record human images, inadvertently capturing behaviours ranging from innocuous actions to potentially serious crimes. 2. With the increasing use of camera traps, there is an urgent need to reflect on how researchers should deal with human images caught on cameras. On the one hand, it is important to respect the privacy of individuals caught on cameras, while, on the other hand, there is a larger public duty to report illegal activity. This creates ethical dilemmas for researchers. 3. Here, based on our camera-trap research on snow leopards Panthera uncia, we outline a general code of conduct to help improve the practice of camera trap based research and help researchers better navigate the ethical-legal tightrope of this important research tool.},

Recent molecular studies have confirmed the fundamental role of the rodent host (Mastomys natalensis) in driving human infections, but control and prevention efforts remain hampered by a limited baseline understanding of the disease’s true incidence, geographical distribution and underlying drivers. Here, we show that Lassa fever occurrence and incidence is influenced by climate, poverty, agriculture and urbanisation factors. However, heterogeneous reporting processes and diagnostic laboratory access also appear to be important drivers of the patchy distribution of observed disease incidence. Using spatiotemporal predictive models we show that including climatic variability added retrospective predictive value over a baseline model (11\% decrease in out-of-sample predictive error). However, predictions for 2020 show that a climate-driven model performs similarly overall to the baseline model. Overall, with ongoing improvements in surveillance there may be potential for forecasting Lassa fever incidence to inform health planning.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever is listed among the diseases that pose the greatest risks to public health by the World Health Organization. This severe viral hemorrhagic fever is caused by Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that repeatedly spills over to humans from its rodent reservoirs. It is currently not known how climate change, transformations in land use, and human population growth could affect the endemic area of this virus, currently limited to parts of West Africa. By exploring the environmental data associated with virus occurrence, we show how temperature, precipitation and the presence of pastures determine ecological suitability for virus circulation. We project that regions in Central and East Africa will likely become suitable for Lassa virus over the next decades and estimate that the total population living in areas suitable for Lassa virus may grow from about 100 million to 700 million by 2070. By analysing geotagged viral genomes, we find that in the event of Lassa virus being introduced into a new suitable region, its spread might remain spatially limited over the first decades. Our results highlight how the endemic area of Lassa virus may expand well beyond West Africa in the next decades due to human impact on the environment, putting hundreds of million more people at risk of infection.},

	abstract = {Forecasting the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir populations of wild or domestic animals is essential for the effective deployment of interventions such as wildlife vaccination or culling. Due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust, spatially explicit, predictions is challenging. Recent efforts have begun to make progress in this direction by capitalizing on machine learning methodologies. An important weakness of existing approaches, however, is that they generally rely on combining human and reservoir infection data during the training process and thus conflate risk attributable to the prevalence of the pathogen in the reservoir population with the risk attributed to the realized rate of spillover into the human population. Because effective planning of interventions requires that these components of risk be disentangled, we developed a multi-layer machine learning framework that separates these processes. Our approach begins by training models to predict the geographic range of the primary reservoir and the subset of this range in which the pathogen occurs. The spillover risk predicted by the product of these reservoir specific models is then fit to data on realized patterns of historical spillover into the human population. The result is a geographically specific spillover risk forecast that can be easily decomposed and used to guide effective intervention. Applying our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that regularly spills over into the human population across West Africa, results in a model that explains a modest but statistically significant portion of geographic variation in historical patterns of spillover. When combined with a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics, our spillover risk model predicts that 897,700 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year across West Africa, with Nigeria accounting for more than half of these human infections.},

The β-generation is born in the main breeding season but reproduces already after abundant off-season rainfall. Its offspring, the γ-generation, is born in the off-season breeding period and breeds in the same year. Life histories of these three generation types are different. Generation α has a long growth stop, poor survival until breeding but up to six consecutive litters; generation β has a short growth stop, a better survival until reproduction but breeds only once or twice. The γ-generation, however, grows very fast and reproduces at young age. Through their daughters, the β-generation thus produces more than seven times as much young as the α-generation before the end of the following year. The occurrence of these generation types partially explains the relationship between rainfall patterns and population fluctuations.},

Males of both species exhibited greater asymptotic values, faster maximum growth rates, later age of maximum growth, and extended growth periods than females. However, neither species established body mass dimorphism before weaning, suggesting that differential maternal investment between sexes is not important in preweaning growth. Furthermore, M. natalensis exhibited significantly faster maximum growth rates to reach a greater predicted asymptotic mass than M. coucha.

In the present study, we used the same specimen collection from 17 villages in Coastal, Upper, and Forest Guinea to investigate the Lassa virus serology in the rodent population. The aim was to determine the dynamics of antibody development in M. natalensis and to detect potential spillover infections in other rodent species. Immunoglobulin G ({IgG}) antibody screening was performed using the indirect immunofluorescence assay with the Guinean Lassa virus strain Bantou 289 as antigen. The overall seroprevalence was 8\% (129/1551) with the following rodents testing positive: 109 M. natalensis, seven Mastomys erythroleucus, four Lemniscomys striatus, four Praomys daltoni, three Mus minutoides, and two Praomys rostratus. Nearly all of them (122/129) originated from Bantou, Tanganya, and Gbetaya, where Lassa virus is highly endemic in M. natalensis. The antibody seroprevalence in M. natalensis from this high-endemic area (27\%; 108/396) depended on the village, habitat, host age, and host abundance. A main positive factor was age; the maximum seroprevalence reached 50\% in older animals. Our data fit with a model implicating that most M. natalensis rodents become horizontally infected, clear the virus within a period significantly shorter than their life span, and develop antibodies. In addition, the detection of antibodies in other species trapped in the habitats of M. natalensis suggests spillover infections.},

	abstract = {Predicting risk of zoonotic diseases, i.e., diseases shared by humans and animals, is often complicated by the population ecology of wildlife host(s). We here demonstrate how ecological knowledge of a disease system can be used for early prediction of human risk using Puumala hantavirus ({PUUV}) in bank voles (Myodes glareolus), which causes Nephropathia epidemica ({NE}) in humans, as a model system. Bank vole populations at northern latitudes exhibit multiannual fluctuations in density and spatial distribution, a phenomenon that has been studied extensively. Nevertheless, existing studies predict {NE} incidence only a few months before an outbreak. We used a time series on cyclic bank vole population density (1972–2013), their {PUUV} infection rates (1979–1986; 2003–2013), and {NE} incidence in Sweden (1990–2013). Depending on the relationship between vole density and infection prevalence (proportion of infected animals), either overall density of bank voles or the density of infected bank voles may be used to predict seasonal {NE} incidence. The density and spatial distribution of voles at density minima of a population cycle contribute to the early warning of {NE} risk later at its cyclic peak. When bank voles remain relatively widespread in the landscape during cyclic minima, {PUUV} can spread from a high baseline during a cycle, culminating in high prevalence in bank voles and potentially high {NE} risk during peak densities.},

	abstract = {Occupancy modelling is a common approach to assess species distribution patterns, while explicitly accounting for false absences in detection–nondetection data. Numerous extensions of the basic single-species occupancy model exist to model multiple species, spatial autocorrelation and to integrate multiple data types. However, development of specialized and computationally efficient software to incorporate such extensions, especially for large datasets, is scarce or absent. We introduce the {spOccupancy} R package designed to fit single-species and multi-species spatially explicit occupancy models. We fit all models within a Bayesian framework using Pólya-Gamma data augmentation, which results in fast and efficient inference. {spOccupancy} provides functionality for data integration of multiple single-species detection–nondetection datasets via a joint likelihood framework. The package leverages Nearest Neighbour Gaussian Processes to account for spatial autocorrelation, which enables spatially explicit occupancy modelling for potentially massive datasets (e.g. 1,000s–100,000s of sites). {spOccupancy} provides user-friendly functions for data simulation, model fitting, model validation (by posterior predictive checks), model comparison (using information criteria and k-fold cross-validation) and out-of-sample prediction. We illustrate the package's functionality via a vignette, simulated data analysis and two bird case studies. The {spOccupancy} package provides a user-friendly platform to fit a variety of single and multi-species occupancy models, making it straightforward to address detection biases and spatial autocorrelation in species distribution models even for large datasets.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of Lassa virus ({LASV}) infections in rodent reservoirs and their endemic human caseloads remain poorly understood. During the endemic period, human infections are believed to be associated with the seasonal migration of Mastomys natalensis, thought to be the primary reservoir that triggers multiple spillovers of {LASV} to humans. It has become imperative to improve {LASV} diagnosis in rodents while updating their prevalence in two regions of Lassa fever endemicity in Nigeria. Rodents (total, 942) were trapped in Ondo (531) and Ebonyi (411) states between October 2018 and April 2020 for detection of {LASV} using various tissues. Overall, the {LASV} prevalence was 53.6\%. The outbreak area sampled in Ondo had three and two times higher capture success and {LASV} prevalence, respectively, than Ebonyi State. This correlated with the higher number of annual cases of Lassa fever ({LF}) in Ondo State versus Ebonyi State. All rodent genera (Mastomys, Rattus, Crocidura, Mus, and Tatera) captured in both states showed slightly variable {LASV} positivity, with Rattus spp. being the most predominantly infected (77.3\%) rodents in Ondo State versus Mastomys spp. (41.6\%) in Ebonyi State. The tissues with the highest {LASV} positivity were the kidneys, spleen, and testes. The finding of a relatively high {LASV} prevalence in all of the rodent genera captured highlights the complex interspecies transmission dynamics of {LASV} infections in the reservoirs and their potential association with increased environmental contact, as well as the risk of zoonotic spillover in these communities, which have the highest prevalence of Lassa fever in Nigeria. {IMPORTANCE} Our findings show the highest {LASV} positivity in small rodents ever recorded and the first direct detection of {LASV} in Tatera spp. Our findings also indicate the abundance of {LASV}-infected small rodents in houses, with probable interspecies transmission through vertical and horizontal coitus routes. Consequently, we suggest that the abundance of different reservoir species for {LASV} may fuel the epizootic outbreaks of {LF} in affected human communities. The high prevalence of {LASV} with the diversity of affected rodents has direct implications for our understanding of the transmission risk, mitigation, and ultimately, the prevention of {LF} in humans. Optimal tissues for {LASV} detection in rodents are also presented.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever is a severe viral hemorrhagic fever caused by a zoonotic virus that repeatedly spills over to humans from its rodent reservoirs. It is currently not known how climate and land use changes could affect the endemic area of this virus, currently limited to parts of West Africa. By exploring the environmental data associated with virus occurrence using ecological niche modelling, we show how temperature, precipitation and the presence of pastures determine ecological suitability for virus circulation. Based on projections of climate, land use, and population changes, we find that regions in Central and East Africa will likely become suitable for Lassa virus over the next decades and estimate that the total population living in ecological conditions that are suitable for Lassa virus circulation may drastically increase by 2070. By analysing geotagged viral genomes using spatially-explicit phylogeography and simulating virus dispersal, we find that in the event of Lassa virus being introduced into a new suitable region, its spread might remain spatially limited over the first decades.

Concurrent with the rise in application of {MSOMs} among ecologists, a quiet regime shift is occurring in Bayesian statistics where predictive model comparison approaches are experiencing a resurgence. Unlike single-species occupancy models that use integrated likelihoods, {MSOMs} are usually couched in a Bayesian framework and contain multiple levels. Standard model checking and selection methods are often unreliable in this setting and there is only limited guidance in the ecological literature for this class of models. We examined several different contemporary Bayesian hierarchical approaches for checking and validating {MSOMs} and applied these methods to a freshwater aquatic study system in Colorado, {USA}, to better understand the diversity and distributions of plains fishes. Our findings indicated distinct differences among model selection approaches, with cross-validation techniques performing the best in terms of prediction.},

However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to 2λ/n, where λ is the real log canonical threshold and n is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.},

	abstract = {Rodents, a diverse, globally distributed and ecologically important order of mammals are nevertheless important reservoirs of known and novel zoonotic pathogens. Ongoing anthropogenic land use change is altering these species’ abundance and distribution, which among zoonotic host species may increase the risk of zoonoses spillover events. A better understanding of the current distribution of rodent species is required to guide attempts to mitigate against potentially increased zoonotic disease hazard and risk. However, available species distribution and host-pathogen association datasets (e.g. {IUCN}, {GBIF}, {CLOVER}) are often taxonomically and spatially biased. Here, we synthesise data from West Africa from 127 rodent trapping studies, published between 1964–2022, as an additional source of information to characterise the range and presence of rodent species and identify the subgroup of species that are potential or known pathogen hosts. We identify that these rodent trapping studies, although biased towards human dominated landscapes across West Africa, can usefully complement current rodent species distribution datasets and we calculate the discrepancies between these datasets. For five regionally important zoonotic pathogens (Arenaviridae spp., Borrelia spp., Lassa mammarenavirus, Leptospira spp. and Toxoplasma gondii), we identify host-pathogen associations that have not been previously reported in host-association datasets. Finally, for these five pathogen groups, we find that the proportion of a rodent hosts range that have been sampled remains small with geographic clustering. A priority should be to sample rodent hosts across a greater geographic range to better characterise current and future risk of zoonotic spillover events. In the interim, studies of spatial pathogen risk informed by rodent distributions must incorporate a measure of the current sampling biases. The current synthesis of contextually rich rodent trapping data enriches available information from {IUCN}, {GBIF} and {CLOVER} which can support a more complete understanding of the hazard of zoonotic spillover events.},

Here, annual reported cases and deaths have been used to estimate the case fatality rate, using three subsets of available data, to understand the scale of underreporting of severe human cases.The literature review produced 38 records of cases and fatalities, comprising 5230 reported cases and 1482 reported deaths in seven countries. The estimated case fatality rate ranges from 16.5 to 25.6\% (standard deviation 11.5–32.2). The expected number of severe cases between 2012 and 2022 is 8995, with current reported numbers 58\% of what is expected.This analysis highlights current uncertainty and systemic underreporting of the morbidity and mortality burden of Lassa fever in its endemic region and must be considered when discussing the epidemiology of this neglected tropical disease.},

The rodent \textit{Mastomys natalensis} has been widely claimed to be the reservoir host of the Lassa virus. This study was designed to investigate the distribution of species of rodents in three states (Edo, Delta and Bayelsa) of Nigeria and to determine the prevalence of Lassa virus amongst trapped rodents in the selected states.{\textless}br{\textgreater}\textit{Methods:} Rodents were trapped during November 2015 to October 2016 from the three states in South-South region of Nigeria. Total {RNA} was extracted from the blood collected from the trapped rodents. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}) was used to confirm the presence of Lassa virus in the rodents.{\textless}br{\textgreater}\textit{Results:} The results revealed that six species of rodents were predominantly present in these geographical locations. \textit{Mus musculus} (39.4\%) had the highest prevalence, closely followed by \textit{Rattus rattus} (36.1\%), \textit{R. fuscipus} (20.3\%), \textit{M. natalensis} (2\%), \textit{Myosoricinae soricidae} (1.2\%) and \textit{R. norvegicus} (1\%). The overall positivity (carrier rate) of Lassa virus was 1.6\% amongst the 1500 rodents caught in the three states. In Edo and Delta States, the {RT}-{PCR} results showed presence of Lassa virus in \textit{R rattus, M. musculus} and \textit{M. natalensis}. On the other hand, only \textit{M. natalensis} was detected with the virus, amongst the species of rodents caught in Bayelsa State. \textit{M. natalensis} recorded the highest Lassa virus among rodents trapped in Edo (87\%), Delta (50\%) and Bayelsa (11\%) States respectively.{\textless}br{\textgreater}\textit{Interpretation \& conclusion:} The rather low Lassa virus positive among rodents in Bayelsa State of Nigeria may explain the absence of reports of outbreak of Lassa fever over the past 48 yr in the state. The results also confirmed that apart from \textit{Mastomys natalensis}, other rodents such as \textit{Rattus rattus} and \textit{Mus musculus} may also serve as reservoirs for Lassa virus. From the findings of this cross-sectional study, it was concluded that a more comprehensive study on rodents as reservoir host, need to be undertaken across the entire states of Nigeria, for better understanding of the epidemiology and endemicity of Lassa fever.{\textless}br{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Small mammals are important to the functioning of ecological communities with changes to their abundances used to track impacts of environmental change. While capture–recapture estimates of absolute abundance are preferred, indices of abundance continue to be used in cases of limited sampling, rare species with little data, or unmarked individuals. Improvement to indices can be achieved by calibrating them to absolute abundance but their reliability across years, sites, or species is unclear. To evaluate this, we used the {US} National Ecological Observatory Network capture–recapture data for 63 small mammal species over 46 sites from 2013 to 2019. We generated 17,155 absolute abundance estimates using capture–recapture analyses and compared these to two standard abundance indices, and three types of calibrated indices. We found that neither raw abundance indices nor index calibrations were reliable approximations of absolute abundance, with raw indices less correlated with absolute abundance than index calibrations (raw indices overall R2 \&lt; 0.5, index calibration overall R2 \&gt; 0.6). Performance of indices and index calibrations varied by species, with those having higher and less variable capture probabilities performing best. We conclude that indices and index calibration methods should be used with caution with a count of individuals being the best index to use, especially if it can be calibrated with capture probability. None of the indices we tested should be used for comparing different species due to high variation in capture probabilities. Hierarchical models that allow for sharing of capture probabilities over species or plots (i.e., joint-likelihood models) may offer a better solution to mitigate the cost and effort of large-scale small mammal sampling while still providing robust estimates of abundance.},

	abstract = {Live-trapping of urban rodents and other small mammals poses several challenges for researchers and pest control professionals ({PMPs}). Most traps are novel to the natural environment and elicit neophobic, or trap-shy, behaviors. Thus, animals captured in traditional traps may either be the least risk-averse, or most desperate. Consequently, individuals of the lowest social ranks, those in poorest health, and the slowest learners are more likely to be captured. This is problematic for research because non-random samples may lead to over-generalization and false conclusions. To address these problems, we developed an inconspicuous, hanging live-trap prototype. In addition to being hard to detect, the trap enables setting several parameters of animal movement and detection before the trap is triggered. The neophobic reaction could then be significantly reduced because animals do not need to enter any trap-like objects—instead they move and feed on a familiar surface. At a time predefined by the user, the triggering mechanism drops a transparent cover over the animal, preventing it from fleeing and enabling either transport to the laboratory, mark-and-release or disposal. Here, we report our initial purpose, design and preliminary results. Animals triggered the trap 34 times during our 1-month preliminary assessment. During this time, 32 individuals were captured (25 Norway rats and 7 house mice) for a 94\% catch rate. Video surveillance revealed no obvious signs of non-random sampling as all trapped rats were representative of a broad range of sizes and ages. There were no signs of low social status (e.g., scar markings, parasitism, or poor health). Importantly, we found a low latency following capture, as released animals showed no instances of increased exploratory or cautious behaviors such as rearing or sniffing, near the hidden traps. More monitoring of this design is needed before future conclusions can be drawn. However, these results should encourage a full range of experimental trials from neuroscientists, urban ecologists, pest control professionals ({PMPs}) and conservationists who seek randomized samples or who work with trap-shy species.},
