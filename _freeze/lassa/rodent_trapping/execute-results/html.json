The natal multimammate mouse (*Mastomys natalensis*) is the primary reservoir host of *Lassa mammarenavirus* (LASV), a zoonotic pathogen causing Lassa fever that is endemic to West Africa. The occurrence and abundance of this species is regulated by the human environment and biotic interactions with other small-mammal species, but these ecological drivers remain poorly understood in the regions where Lassa fever outbreaks are observed.\n  2.  We developed a Bayesian multi-species occupancy model incorporating incomplete detection to assess habitat use from data obtained as part of a multi-year small-mammal trapping study (43,226 trap nights across four village sites in Sierra Leone, 2020-2023). We investigated the effects of land use gradients and small-mammal community dynamics on the spatial distribution of *M. natalensis*.\n  3.  *Mastomys natalensis* occupancy increased along a gradient from forest to agriculture to village habitats but was reduced in peri-urban settings compared to rural settings. Invasive rodent species influenced this pattern, with Mus musculus presence associated with reduced *M. natalensis* occupancy in peri-urban settings. We did not observe a similar effect when considering the co-occurrence of invasive *Rattus rattus* with *M. natalensis* in rural settings.\n  4.  These findings suggest that land use and species interactions drive spatial heterogeneity in *M. natalensis* populations, potentially explaining reduced Lassa fever incidence in urban areas. The results highlight the importance of considering community dynamics when predicting the risk of outbreaks of endemic zoonoses and the need to widen the context of studies of LASV transmission beyond the primary reservoir host species.\n  5.  To better assess public health risk and improve allocation of limited resources, we recommend more precise characterisation of small-mammal communities in LASV endemic regions, particularly in areas undergoing rapid land use change which may alter community level small-mammal biodiversity.\nauthor: \n  - name: \"David Simons\"\n    affiliation: The Royal Veterinary College\ncategories: [Rodent, Ecology, Zoonosis, Lassa Fever, Preprint, Landuse Change]\nimage: files/rodent_landuse/Figure_1a.png\nbibliography: lassa.bib\ndate: 2023-10-01\ncitation: true\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n---\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Authors\n\nDavid Simons ^1,2,3^, Rory Gibb ^2,4^, Umaru Bangura ^5,6^, Dianah Sondufu ^6^, Joyce Lamin ^6^, James Koninga ^7^, Momoh Jimmy ^7^, Mike Dawson ^6^, Joseph Lahai ^6^, Rashid Ansumana ^6^, Elisabeth Fichet-Calvet ^5^, Deborah Watson-Jones ^3,8^, Richard Kock ^1^, Kate E.

While habitat preferences of *Mastomys natalensis* have been well studied in West Africa to better understand the risk to human populations from *Lassa mammarenavirus* spillover [@fichetcalvet_diversity_2010], there is limited understanding of the wider rodent species communities. Biotic interactions between different species will drive occurrence and abundance in different habitats and this study was designed to understand how these species co-exist in these habitats.\n\nWe conducted repeated, systematic, rodent trapping in the Eastern province of Sierra Leone, along a landuse gradient to model the association of landuse and occurrence of *M. natalensis* and more generally small mammal communities. We aimed to investigate the following questions. First, what is the diversity of rodent communities in varied landuse types in Eastern Sierra Leone? Second, how do patterns of landuse affect the occupancy of *M. natalensis* and other sympatric rodents? Finally, is there evidence that the local spatial distribution of *M. natalensis* is regulated by biotic interactions with co-occurring species? We expect these analyses to further our understanding of rodent community structures that may explain observed patterns of Lassa fever spillover.\n\nA protocol was developed prior to a pilot trapping session in November 2020.
