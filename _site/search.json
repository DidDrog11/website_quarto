I am supervised by an interdisciplinary team of researchers, Prof. Richard Kock (RVC), Prof. Deborah Watson-Jones (LSHTM), and Prof. Kate Jones (UCL). My research interests fit within the fields of Planetary Health and One Health with a particular focus on the effect of anthropogenic change on the risks of zoonotic infectious disease emergence and subsequent spread. I use systems approaches to understand the interaction between human and biological factors on these risks. We are currently based in San Diego, USA where, Olga Perski’s Marie Skłodowska–Curie fellowship is based at the University of California San Diego.\n\n\nMy PhD research is predominantly focused in Sierra Leone, West Africa with Lassa fever, Monkeypox and Ebola as model disease systems. I adopt interdisciplinary approaches using methods from clinical medicine, epidemiology, mathematical modelling and systems biology. I am a member of the PANDORA-ID-net consortium and work closely with collaborators on the One Health theme. My field work is conducted with colleagues based at Njala University in Sierra Leone. With this work I aim to develop dynamic models of disease risk and translate these into policy implementations to promote the health and wellbeing of human communities in low resource settings within a planetary health framework. I am also interested in the area of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), another topic benefiting from a One Health approach.\nI am a proponent of Open Science with pre-specified research questions and study protocols posted to the Open Science Framework.

Alongside my clinical work during the COVID-19 pandemic I have contributed to the work of LSHTM’s Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases to understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and potential control measures.\nAlongside my PhD programme I worked with Public Health England (now the UK Health Security Agency). I was based in the Outbreak Surveillance Team starting shortly before the beginning of the Omicron variant importation and spread. During this period I was responsible for producing an automated approach to monitoring real time reported cases exploring spatial spread and informing contact tracing and the initial public health response. This work led to several insights which have been written up and published. I was nominated for and received an award for my contribution to the immediate response to Omicron emergence. I was also involved in the UK Monkeypox outbreak investigating how we could understand transmission parameters using contact tracing data within the dense community networks in which cases were identified.\n\n\n\nThe Royal Veterinary College | London, UK\nPhD in Epidemiology of Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases | Sep 2019 - Ongoing\nThe London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine | London, UK\nMSc in Tropical Medicine and International Health | Sep 2018 - Sep 2019\nThe London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine | London, UK\nDTM&H Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | Sep 2018 - Dec 2018\nGuy’s, King’s and St. Thomas’ Medical School, King’s College London | London, UK\nMBBS in Medicine and Surgery | Sep 2012 - Sep 2016\nUniversity of Leeds | Leeds, UK\nMSc in Biodiversity and Conservation | Sep 2010 - Sep 2011\nUniversity of Leeds | Leeds, UK\nBSc in Natural Sciences w/ Industrial Placement | Sep 2006 -Sep 2010"

Several commercial PCR and antibody kits are available. To our knowledge there no pan-species antibody assays. To support our ongoing work on understanding the epidemiology and transmission dynamics in multi-species systems in endemic regions we have begun developing a cross-species assay. We adopted an approach that has been found to be successful for Peste des petits ruminants a virus that affects goats, sheep and camels and is targeted for eradication. These assays are built on the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System [@berguido_specific_2016] which detect the presence of antibodies against the presented antigen.\nOur work so far in the development of the assay is presented in the following posts:\n\nIdentification of potential antigenic epitopes"

    "text": "The niche of One Health approaches in Lassa fever surveillance and control [@arruda2021niche]\nLassa fever (LF), a zoonotic illness, represents a public health burden in West African countries where the Lassa virus (LASV) circulates among rodents. Human exposure hinges significantly on LASV ecology, which is in turn shaped by various parameters such as weather seasonality and even virus and rodent-host genetics. Furthermore, human behaviour, despite playing a key role in the zoonotic nature of the disease, critically affects either the spread or control of human-to-human transmission. Previous estimations on LF burden date from the 80s and it is unclear how the population expansion and the improvement on diagnostics and surveillance methods have affected such predictions. Although recent data have contributed to the awareness of epidemics, the real impact of LF in West African communities will only be possible with the intensification of interdisciplinary efforts in research and public health approaches. This review discusses the causes and consequences of LF from a One Health perspective, and how the application of this concept can improve the surveillance and control of this disease in West Africa.\n\nLink to publication"
