I adopt interdisciplinary approaches using methods from clinical medicine, epidemiology, mathematical modelling and systems biology. I am a member of the PANDORA-ID-net consortium and work closely with collaborators on the One Health theme. My field work is conducted with colleagues based at Njala University in Sierra Leone. With this work I aim to develop dynamic models of disease risk and translate these into policy implementations to promote the health and wellbeing of human communities in low resource settings within a planetary health framework. I am also interested in the area of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), another topic benefiting from a One Health approach.\nI am a proponent of Open Science with pre-specified research questions and study protocols posted to the Open Science Framework. I am developing my programming skills and will continue to try and make all code used for my analyses available in reproducible files hosted on my GitHub page.

    "text": "Omicron response work\n\nVaccine effectiveness\nFollowing the emergence and rapid spread of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2 there was substantial interest in the effectiveness of current vaccines. A test-negative case-control design was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease compared to the previously circulating Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. We observed that primary vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 vaccine provided limited protection against symptomatic disease. Booster vaccination following a completed primary course increased protection, but protection waned over time [@andrews2022covid]. This work has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine\n\n\nVariant detection\nWithin UKHSA we were fortunate that we could monitor the emergence of Omicron against the background of the prior Delta wave. This was possible as many of the laboratories conducting surveillance were able to detect S-gene target failure allowing differentiation between Omicron and Delta. This led to rapid identification of possible Omicron cases, alongside real-time surveillance and modelling of Omicron growth. This was key to initial public health action (including case identification and incident management), and we share applied insights on how and when these surveillance approaches can inform public health interventions[@blomquist2022enhancing]. This work has been published in Eurosurveillance.\n\n\nComparing transmission of Omicron and Delta\nThis epidemiological study assessed differences in transmissibility between the Omicron and Delta. We used contact tracing data alongside national surveillance to estimate the transmission parameters. We found that the proportion of index cases resulting in a cluster of transmission was twice as high for Omicron (16.1%) compared to Delta (7.3%). Our study identified increased risk of onward transmission of Omicron, consistent with its successful global displacement of Delta [@allen2022comparative]. This work is currently registered as a pre-print on MedRxiv\n\n\nThe use of clinical assessment tools in UK hospitals\nIn my clinical role I was involved in a large scale audit of the use of the 4C COVID mortality score. The 4C Mortality Score (4C Score) was designed to risk stratify hospitalised patients with COVID-19. We assessed the inclusion of this score in COVID-19 management guidance and its documentation in patients’ case notes in January 2021 in UK hospitals. We found that score documentation in case notes was highly variable. Higher documentation of 4C Score was associated with score integration within admissions proformas, inclusion of 4C Score variables or link to online calculator, and management decisions. Integration of 4C Score within clinical pathways may encourage more widespread use [@blunsum2021evaluation]. This work is currently registered as a pre-print on MedRxiv"

We obtained GenBank data on Lassa mammarenavirus sequences to investigate the phylogeny of these samples and to understand how biased these may be as a dataset. We were particularly interested in how many human derived sequences were obtained from the different regions with known outbreaks of human disease and comparing this to the coverage of rodent derived sequences.\nWe found that there is important spatial heterogeneity in where samples are obtained from that does not match the known distribution of rodent infections and human cases. For example, most human sequences came from Nigeria and Eastern Sierra Leone. While most rodent sequences came from Guinea and Eastern Sierra Leone with very few from Nigeria. This disparity likely has an important impact on the inference that can be drawn from phylogeographic studies of Lassa mammarenavirus."

While habitat preferences of Mastomys natalensis have been well studied in West Africa to better understand the risk to human populations from Lassa mammarenavirus spillover (Fichet‐Calvet et al. 2010), there is limited understanding of the wider rodent species assemblages. The interaction between different species will govern occurrence and abundance in different habitats and this study was designed to understand how these species co-exist in these habitats.\nTo understand the association between land-use on the occurrence of M. natalensis and more generally, the rodent species assemblage structure. We explore the occurrence of rodent species’ at our trapping sites and describe these species assemblages. Second, we model the association of land-use with the probability of species occupancy at trapping sites and then model the probability of co-occurrence between different species detected in our study to understand competition between small mammal species in our study region. Together these analyses will further our understanding of rodent species assemblage structures and the hazard of Lassa fever outbreaks based on host species occurrence."

    "text": "When considering the risk of human infection from zoonotic infectious diseases the distribution of known hosts is used to spatially define the extent of risk. These data are typically derived from sources including range maps from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species and presence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The prevalence of pathogens within these ranges can then be used to infer risk to human populations, for example (Han, Kramer, and Drake 2016) and (Basinski et al. 2021).\nAdditional data that can contribute to these approaches are available in rodent trapping studies. Unfortunately, these have not been synthesised in a manner that would support their use. We aimed to produce a dataset that could be used when investigating the risk of zoonotic spillover and novel pathogen emergence in rodents in West Africa. We compared this to currently available datasets to identify areas of rodent and pathogen sampling bias to identify regions that would benefit from increased sampling effort. To assess the completeness of current datasets of host-pathogen associations, namely CLOVER (Gibb, Carlson, and Farrell 2021) we extracted data on testing of trapped rodents for pathogens and calculated the proportion of a rodents range in which these pathogens were sampled for.\nThe data has been prepared to support re-use and is available online in a Zenodo repository and Google sheets document.

The earliest trapping studies were conducted in 1964, with a trend of increasing numbers of studies being performed annually since 2000. The median year of first trapping activity was 2007, with the median length of trapping activity being 1 year (IQR 0-2 years). Studies were conducted in 14 West African countries, with no studies reported from The Gambia or Togo, at 1,611 trap sites (Fig 1.).\nIncluded studies explicitly reported on 601,184 trap nights, a further 341,445 trap nights were imputed from studies with no recording of trapping effort based on trap success, leading to an estimate of 942,629 trap nights (Fig 1B.). A minority of studies trapped at a single study site (30, 24%), with 46 (36%) trapping at between two and five sites, the remaining 51 studies (40%) trapped at between six and 93 study sites.\n\n\n\nFig 1. Rodent trapping sites across West Africa. A) The location of trapping sites in West Africa. No sites were recorded from Togo or The Gambia. Heterogeneity is observed in the coverage of each country by trap night (colour) and location of sites. For example, Senegal, Mali and Sierra Leone have generally good coverage compared to Guinea and Burkina Faso. B) Histogram of trap nights performed at each study site, a median of 248 trap nights (IQR 116-500) was performed at each site\n\n\nIn total 76,275 small mammals were trapped with 65,628 (90%) identified to species level and 7,439 (10%) identified to genus, with the remaining classified to higher taxonomic level. The majority of the 132 identified species were Rodentia (102, 78%), of which Muridae (73, 72%) were the most common family. Soricomorpha were the second most identified order of small mammals (28, 21%). 57 studies tested for 32 microorganisms, defined to species or genus level that are known or potential pathogens. Most studies tested for a single microorganism (48, 84%). The most frequently assayed microorganisms were Lassa mammarenavirus or Arenaviridae (21, 37%), Borrelia sp. (9, 16%), Bartonella sp. (4, 7%) and Toxoplasma gondii (4, 7%). Most studies used Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to detect microorganisms (37, 65%), with fewer studies using serology-based tests (11, 19%) or histological or direct visualisation assays (11, 21%). From 32,920 individual rodent samples we produced 351 host-pathogen pairs.

Trapping effort was greatest in Eastern Senegal, the border region between Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and Southern Ghana, Togo and Nigeria. Much of Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria have been relatively under-sampled.\n\n\n\nFig 2. Relative trapping effort bias across West Africa.Modelled relative trapping effort bias adjusted for human population density, proportion urban land cover and area of the administrative region. Brown regions represent areas with a bias towards increased trapping effort (e.g., North West Senegal), Green regions represent areas with a bias towards reduced trapping effort (e.g., Northern Nigeria).\n\n\n\n\nComparison to IUCN and GBIF data\nWe compared the distribution of commonly trapped rodents that would be inferred from these trapping data compared to GBIF detection data and ranges available from IUCN. We found that while the expected range of native, widespread rodents, such as Mastomys natalensis was well captured in the IUCN ranges it lacked the additional information of non-detection that can be seen from trapping studies (Fig 3.). For invasive rodent species, IUCN ranges were less suitable, particularly for Mus musculus which is not shown to have any range in West Africa. Compared to GBIF data sampling locations were more widespread across the region with additional non-detection information available from rodent trapping studies. A discrepancy in the locations of Mus musculus was observed. GBIF data suggests widespread occurrence of this species in Togo which did not match data from several rodent trapping studies performed in this region.\n\n\n\nFig 3. Locations of detection and non-detection sites for rodent species in West Africa. Each row corresponds to a single rodent species. L) Presence recorded in GBIF (black points) overlaid on IUCN species range (red-shaded area). R) Detection (purple) and non-detection (orange) from rodent trapping studies overlaid on IUCN species ranges. M. musculus has no IUCN West African range.\n\n\nWe found that consolidating these three sources of data provided better coverage of a rodents detection and non-detection range than any individual source of data alone.\n\n\nHost-pathogen associations\nCLOVER is a dataset combining four host-pathogen association datasets: EcoHealth Alliance’s HP3, The University of Georgia’s Global Mammal Parasite Database, The University of Liverpool’s Enhanced Infectious Diseases 2 database and one shared through a publication by (Shaw et al. 2020). We compared the host-pathogen associations within this source with those we extracted from rodent trapping studies for both assays for acute infection (i.e. PCR) and evidence of prior infection (i.e. seroprevalence).\nWe identified 25 host-pathogen pairs among 14 rodent and 6 pathogen species (Fig 4. and Fig 5.). We identified negative associations (non-detection through specific assays) for 45 host-pathogen pairs among 35 rodent and 7 pathogen species. CLOVER contained 10 (40%) of our identified host-pathogen associations, the remaining 15 (60%) were not found to be present in CLOVER, additionally CLOVER recorded positive associations for 4 (9%) of the negative associations produced from the rodent trapping data.\n\n\n\nFig 4. Host-Pathogen associations detected through acute infection. A) Identified species level host-pathogen associations through detection of acute infection (i.e. PCR, culture). Percentages and colour relate to the proportion of all assays that were positive, the number of individuals tested for the pathogen is labelled N. Associations with a black border are present in the CLOVER dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 5. Host-Pathogen associations detected through evidence of prior infection. B) Identified species level host-pathogen associations through serological assays (i.e. ELISA). Percentages and colour relate to the proportion of all assays that were positive, the number of individuals tested for the pathogen is labelled N. Associations with a black border are present in the CLOVER dataset.\n\n\nCLOVER also included an additional 492 host-pathogen associations we do not observe in rodent trapping studies. The majority of these 392 (80%) pairs are from species with global distributions (M. musculus, R. rattus and R. norvegicus), or from those with wide ranging distributions in sub-Saharan Africa (38, 8%) (i.e., A. niloticus, M. natalensis and Atelerix albiventris).\nAn additional advantage of this data is that spatial information on the location of pathogen detection is available for some, while databases such as CLOVER do not contain locations or positive or negative results."

Together this supports their inclusion in efforts to model endemic zoonotic risk and novel pathogen emergence.\nFuture rodent trapping studies should be targeted towards regions that are currently under-studied. Further information on rodent presence and abundance across West Africa will aid the modelling of changing endemic zoonosis risk and the potential for novel pathogen emergence. Sharing of disaggregated data alongside research publications should be promoted with adoption of data standards to support ongoing data synthesis. Specifically, inclusion of exact locations of trapping sites, trapping effort and the dates at which trapping occurred would support more detailed inference of the spatio-temporal dynamics of host populations and the risk of endemic zoonosis spillover events. Despite these challenges we propose that rodent trapping studies can provide an important source of data to supplement curated datasets on rodent distributions to quantify the risk of endemic zoonosis spillover events and the hazard of novel pathogen emergence."

    "text": "I have been involved in two recently published pieces of work. The first, investigating Monkeypox community transmission following introduction into the UK identified as three separate incidents.\n\nCommunity transmission of Monkeypox\nMonkeypox is a re-emerging zoonotic infection caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV). In the past case detection has been primarily detected in West and Central Africa. The incubation period of monkeypox can be up to 21 days. In the United Kingdom (UK) all previous seven cases ever reported were either imported, or household or healthcare contacts of imported cases. In this report, we described an ongoing outbreak of MPXV infections in the UK, detected since the beginning of May 2022 affecting people without documented history of travel to endemic countries [@vivancos2022community]. This work has been published in Eurosurveillance.\n\n\nCurrent research gaps in understanding Monkeypox spillover\nIn this work we explored the research gaps on Monkeypox (MPX) virus epidemiology in endemic countries. We presented hypotheses for the recent increase of MPX cases in West Africa as a possible explanation for the current outbreak of internationally distributed cases. First, that the true burden of MPX in West and Central Africa is poorly understood. Second, that the diversity and extent of the animal reservoir remains unknown. We hypothesised that the changing human-rodent interaction rates in recent years may facilitate increased transmission of MPXV in endemic settings. We further hypothesised that following the end of routine smallpox vaccination, the larger and more interconnected immune-naïve population has crossed a threshold resulting in more sustainable human-to-human transmission of MPXV. We call for local led research efforts on the estimation of the basic and effective reproduction rate (R0 and Re) in different populations is required [@haiderincreased]. This work has been published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases"
