The 4C Mortality Score (4C Score) was designed to risk stratify hospitalised patients with COVID-19. We assessed the inclusion of this score in COVID-19 management guidance and its documentation in patients’ case notes in January 2021 in UK hospitals. We found that score documentation in case notes was highly variable. Higher documentation of 4C Score was associated with score integration within admissions proformas, inclusion of 4C Score variables or link to online calculator, and management decisions. Integration of 4C Score within clinical pathways may encourage more widespread use (Blunsum et al. 2022). This work is currently registered as a pre-print on MedRxiv.\n\n\nRECOVERY trial\nThe RECOVERY trial is an international clinical trial that aimed to identify potential treatments for COVID-19, the open label trial was regularly reviewed to rapidly identify potentially efficacious treatments. This led to early evidence of the benefit of steroids, antivirals and antibody therapy. UCLH was one of the clinical sites for this trial and I assisted in identifying and enrolling patients into this vital trial.\n\n\nHealth needs assessments in temporarily housed individuals experiencing homelessness\nAs part of the COVID-19 response hotels and hostels were used to house individuals with no locations where they were able to isolate or reduce their risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We were focussed primarily on COVID-19, tuberculosis, hepatitis, mental health, sexual health and drug and alcohol services although support was provided for a wide range of medical and social issues.

To be able to incorporate this data into our analysis on the association of current- and former-smoking on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 disease severity and mortality we adopted a living review approach where we screened the literature at regular intervals to identify sources of information. Initial reports were posted as pre-prints with Version 7 of the review published in the journal Addiction (Simons et al. 2021a). During this process we changed from a classical statistical approach to Bayesian analysis to account for updating information as well as allowing us to incorporate prior evidence from previous versions of the review. We continued to update this analysis to Version 12 which was completed in August 2021 (Simons et al. 2021b).\nWe spent a large amount of time considering the issues with interpreting observational data through a causal lens. The main challenges are highlighted below. We wrote a commentary on the level of evidence we believed would be important to consider to truly understand the association of smoking and this disease (Perski et al. 2021).\n\n\n\nChallenges with interpreting observational data relating to smoking and COVID-19 infection\n\n\nWe also reviewed clinical case notes from University College London Hospital to compare rates of hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared to other viral illnesses for current- and former-smokers (Simons et al. 2022).\nWe planned to analyse the Office for National Statistics COVID infection survey dataset to gain further evidence on the association of smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The protocol has been deposited on the OSF (Perski 2021). This work has been put on hold as we are now not based in the UK although we hope that this work will be taken up."

    "text": "My role was to develop the system and maintain a linelist of cases suspected to be caused by this new variant and to provide epidemiological data in real time to guide the public health response to this rapidly changing landscape. With previous variants that became widespread, Alpha and Delta introduction of cases typically occurred at periods of low levels of underlying transmission (due to behavioural interventions such as lockdowns and travel restrictions), this was not the case with Omicron where introduction occurred in the setting of high levels of community transmission. This made it more challenging to monitor changing case patterns and to evaluate suitable responses.\nFortunately, UKHSA had a well developed laboratory network for both community and hospital acquired samples with PCR kits that were able to identify the SGTF feature of Omicron against a background of the dominant variant (Delta) that did not have SGTF. This allowed us to perform real time surveillance of the expanding number of cases and geographic expansion following introduction of the variant.\nThe primary concern was that vaccines may be less effective against Omicron than they would be against other variants. We also were involved in work comparing the transmissibility of Omicron against Delta using national surveillance data.\n\nVaccine effectiveness\nFollowing the emergence and rapid spread of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2 there was substantial interest in the effectiveness of current vaccines. A test-negative case-control design was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease compared to the previously circulating Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. We observed that primary vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 vaccine provided limited protection against symptomatic disease. Booster vaccination following a completed primary course increased protection, but protection waned over time [@andrews_covid-19_2022]. This work has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine\n\n\nVariant detection\nWithin UKHSA we were fortunate that we could monitor the emergence of Omicron against the background of the prior Delta wave. This was possible as many of the laboratories conducting surveillance were able to detect S-gene target failure allowing differentiation between Omicron and Delta. This led to rapid identification of possible Omicron cases, alongside real-time surveillance and modelling of Omicron growth. This was key to initial public health action (including case identification and incident management), and we share applied insights on how and when these surveillance approaches can inform public health interventions[@blomquist_enhancing_2022]. This work has been published in Eurosurveillance.\n\n\nComparing transmission of Omicron and Delta\nThis epidemiological study assessed differences in transmissibility between the Omicron and Delta. We used contact tracing data alongside national surveillance to estimate the transmission parameters. We found that the proportion of index cases resulting in a cluster of transmission was twice as high for Omicron (16.1%) compared to Delta (7.3%). Our study identified increased risk of onward transmission of Omicron, consistent with its successful global displacement of Delta [@allen_comparative_2022]. This work is currently registered as a pre-print on MedRxiv\n\n\nEvaluating the effect of travel restrictions on the transmission of imported variants\nA piece of ongoing work is assessing the rate of geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants across the UK following introduction. We are interested in comparing the speed of this initial spread taking into account the underlying transmission dynamics at the time to evaluate the effectiveness of implementing travel bans once a variant has been detected.\n\n\n\nThese are some initial results from our study of the time to detection of each SARS-CoV-2 variant in a Lower Level Super Output Area (the smallest UK geographic statistical unit) following the detection of the variant within the UK. Left is wildtype which was first detected around York in the North of the country, unfilled regions are those areas that did not identify a case prior to introduction of the next variant. Second from left is Alpha, this variant was first detected in the UK and was identified in the South East of the country. This variant was detected during a period of low background transmission and took much longer to be detected across the country. Second from right is Delta, this variant was first detected in India and was introduced to the UK simultaneously in the areas around Liverpool and Birmingham, this variant led to a rapid rise in the rate of transmission and had been detected everywhere prior to introduction of Omicron. Right is Omicron, this was imported during a period of high background transmission of Delta variant. The first case was detected in the South East of England, although within a month was detected across most of the country."

We obtained GenBank data on Lassa mammarenavirus sequences to investigate the phylogeny of these samples and to understand how biased these may be as a dataset. We were particularly interested in how many human derived sequences were obtained from the different regions with known outbreaks of human disease and comparing this to the coverage of rodent derived sequences.\nWe found that there is important spatial heterogeneity in where samples are obtained from that does not match the known distribution of rodent infections and human cases. For example, most human sequences came from Nigeria and Eastern Sierra Leone. While most rodent sequences came from Guinea and Eastern Sierra Leone with very few from Nigeria. This disparity likely has an important impact on the inference that can be drawn from phylogeographic studies of Lassa mammarenavirus.\n\n\n\nThe majority of human derived Lassa mammarenavirus sequences have been obtained from two states in South Nigeria, with few samples from elsewhere.

This has led to an increasing number of publications on this viral infection. These publications face the same challenge when discussing the number of cases. Current estimates are based on research conducted in the 1970-80s which have not been updated to include changes in human populations in West Africa, alongside other factors such as land use change. A recent publication by (Basinski et al. 2021) attempted to estimate updated numbers of infections across the region, suggesting between 900,000-4.4 million infections per year.\n\n\n\nThe number of publications on Lassa Fever is increasing with time as a result of increased research interest and funding.\n\n\nA further complication is the conversion of infections to clinical cases. The WHO reports that around 80% of acute infections are asymptomatic, the evidence behind this is limited. I was interested in seeing if we can use information about the reported Case Fatality Rate to estimate the number of clinical cases that may be going un-reported across the region. I have maintained a dataset on the number of reported of Lassa Fever cases across the region from epidemiological report, the sources that contribute to this dataset do not provide any estimates on the proportion of “true” cases that are detected which I believe results in significant undercounting.\n\n\n\nThe number of reported Lassa Fever cases by year and country.\n\n\nThis assessment will be based on several assumptions:\n1: The reporting of deaths is more complete than the reporting of cases.\n2: The proportion of confirmed cases that die from the disease does not vary drastically by country or year.\n3: Reported cases are all clinical/symptomatic cases and none have been identified from asymptomatic infections.\nThese assumptions are not likely to be met and therefore this estimate of under-reported cases is crude. For example, the probability of a death being accurately attributed to Lassa Fever will likely vary by location and time period. Certain regions, based on prior experience of outbreaks, may be more likely to suspect Lassa Fever as a cause of death and so may be more likely to perform testing. The historic pattern of a peak in Lassa Fever cases in the early months of the year in Nigeria may introduce a temporal bias. Clinicians may be more likely to suspect Lassa Fever during these periods than at other times of the year and so testing may be dependent on season. To understand these patterns we would need information on proportion of tests that are positive. To my knowledge this data is not available.\nIt is unlikely that Case Fatality Rate does not vary spatially or temporally. Health care access and services differ across the region. The access to care for Lassa Fever is potentially greater in regions with specialised services, such as Irrua Teaching Hospital, Nigeria and the Lassa Fever ward at Kenema General Hospital, Sierra Leone. This may alter the outcomes of clinical cases. An example of temporal factors that may alter CFR include the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During lockdowns and periods of high case rates the time to diagnosis for symptomatic individuals may be prolonged and therefore outcomes may be worse, leading to an increased CFR.\nImprovements in Lassa Fever awareness have resulted in changes to how cases and contacts are identified. Previously individuals with severe symptoms who did not respond to anti-malarial and anti-bacterial therapy would be tested for Lassa Fever. Improvements in diagnostic capacity, particularly in Nigeria have now resulted in testing being used for symptomatic contacts of confirmed cases. These individuals would previously have not been diagnosed and so including them in confirmed cases may lower the CFR from historical levels.\nFurther research will be required to understand the true degree of under-reporting of symptomatic Lassa Fever cases. Despite this, I think this work should help to encourage researchers consider the biases behind reported case numbers."

    "text": "Method\nA dataset of reported deaths and cases for Lassa Fever was produced from several sources including ProMED mail, WHO weekly bulletins, Nigeria CDC Lassa Fever situation reports and academic publications. This dataset, with sources is available here. I took three approaches to estimating the CFR from these data.\n1: Across all records, the number of reported deaths was divided by the number of reported cases. If the number of deaths exceed the number of cases, the number of suspected cases was used in place of cases.\n2: Across all Nigeria CDC data, the number of reported deaths was divided by the number of reported cases. If the number of deaths exceed the number of cases, the number of suspected cases was used in place of cases.\n3: Using only data from Edo and Ondo states, as these historically have the greatest number of reported cases and greatest access to diagnostic capacity. The number of reported deaths was divided by the number of reported cases.\nFrom these CFRs for each record values of 0% and 100% were removed and a weighted mean CFR was calculated based on the number of reported deaths.\nThese weighted mean CFRs were then used to calculate the proportion of cases for each country that were un-reported based on the reported number of deaths."

    "text": "Results\nThe estimated CFRs for method 1 and 2 did not differ importantly, producing estimates around 25%. Relying only on data from Edo and Ondo states, in method 3 produced an estimate of 16.2%, this is likely closest to the true CFR of Lassa Fever following development of severe symptoms. Using this value the degree of under-reporting was found to differ by country. The greatest under-reporting was from Liberia, Benin, Guinea and Ghana. However, Nigeria, Liberia, Benin and Sierra Leone are most likely to be the countries under-reporting the greatest number of severe infections. This difference arises as these latter countries have the highest number of outbreaks and deaths attributed to Lassa Fever.\n\n\n\nA) Case Fatality Rate of Lassa fever Fever following development of symptomatic disease and presenting to healthcare using three data sources for estimation. Method 1 uses all reported cases and deaths where the CFR is not equal to 0% or 100%. Method 2 uses all reported cases and deaths provided by NCDC data prior to 2021 where the CFR is not equal to 0% or 100%. Method 3 uses all reported cases and deaths from Edo and Ondo state from 2017-2021. The black line represents the weighted mean CFR.

While habitat preferences of Mastomys natalensis have been well studied in West Africa to better understand the risk to human populations from Lassa mammarenavirus spillover (Fichet‐Calvet et al. 2010), there is limited understanding of the wider rodent species assemblages. The interaction between different species will govern occurrence and abundance in different habitats and this study was designed to understand how these species co-exist in these habitats.\nTo understand the association between land-use on the occurrence of M. natalensis and more generally, the rodent species assemblage structure. We explore the occurrence of rodent species’ at our trapping sites and describe these species assemblages. Second, we model the association of land-use with the probability of species occupancy at trapping sites and then model the probability of co-occurrence between different species detected in our study to understand competition between small mammal species in our study region. Together these analyses will further our understanding of rodent species assemblage structures and the hazard of Lassa fever outbreaks based on host species occurrence."

These data are typically derived from sources including range maps from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species and presence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The prevalence of pathogens within these ranges can then be used to infer risk to human populations, for example (Han, Kramer, and Drake 2016) and (Basinski et al. 2021).\nAdditional data that can contribute to these approaches are available in rodent trapping studies. Unfortunately, these have not been synthesised in a manner that would support their use. We aimed to produce a dataset that could be used when investigating the risk of zoonotic spillover and novel pathogen emergence in rodents in West Africa. We compared this to currently available datasets to identify areas of rodent and pathogen sampling bias to identify regions that would benefit from increased sampling effort. To assess the completeness of current datasets of host-pathogen associations, namely CLOVER (Gibb, Carlson, and Farrell 2021) we extracted data on testing of trapped rodents for pathogens and calculated the proportion of a rodents range in which these pathogens were sampled for.\nThe data has been prepared to support re-use and is available online in a Zenodo repository and Google sheets document.

The earliest trapping studies were conducted in 1964, with a trend of increasing numbers of studies being performed annually since 2000. The median year of first trapping activity was 2007, with the median length of trapping activity being 1 year (IQR 0-2 years). Studies were conducted in 14 West African countries, with no studies reported from The Gambia or Togo, at 1,611 trap sites (Fig 1.).\nIncluded studies explicitly reported on 601,184 trap nights, a further 341,445 trap nights were imputed from studies with no recording of trapping effort based on trap success, leading to an estimate of 942,629 trap nights (Fig 1B.). A minority of studies trapped at a single study site (30, 24%), with 46 (36%) trapping at between two and five sites, the remaining 51 studies (40%) trapped at between six and 93 study sites.\n\n\n\nFig 1. Rodent trapping sites across West Africa. A) The location of trapping sites in West Africa. No sites were recorded from Togo or The Gambia. Heterogeneity is observed in the coverage of each country by trap night (colour) and location of sites.

B) Histogram of trap nights performed at each study site, a median of 248 trap nights (IQR 116-500) was performed at each site\n\n\nIn total 76,275 small mammals were trapped with 65,628 (90%) identified to species level and 7,439 (10%) identified to genus, with the remaining classified to higher taxonomic level. The majority of the 132 identified species were Rodentia (102, 78%), of which Muridae (73, 72%) were the most common family. Soricomorpha were the second most identified order of small mammals (28, 21%). 57 studies tested for 32 microorganisms, defined to species or genus level that are known or potential pathogens. Most studies tested for a single microorganism (48, 84%). The most frequently assayed microorganisms were Lassa mammarenavirus or Arenaviridae (21, 37%), Borrelia sp. (9, 16%), Bartonella sp. (4, 7%) and Toxoplasma gondii (4, 7%). Most studies used Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to detect microorganisms (37, 65%), with fewer studies using serology-based tests (11, 19%) or histological or direct visualisation assays (11, 21%). From 32,920 individual rodent samples we produced 351 host-pathogen pairs.

Trapping effort was greatest in Eastern Senegal, the border region between Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and Southern Ghana, Togo and Nigeria. Much of Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria have been relatively under-sampled.\n\n\n\nFig 2. Relative trapping effort bias across West Africa.Modelled relative trapping effort bias adjusted for human population density, proportion urban land cover and area of the administrative region. Brown regions represent areas with a bias towards increased trapping effort (e.g., North West Senegal), Green regions represent areas with a bias towards reduced trapping effort (e.g., Northern Nigeria).\n\n\n\n\nComparison to IUCN and GBIF data\nWe compared the distribution of commonly trapped rodents that would be inferred from these trapping data compared to GBIF detection data and ranges available from IUCN. We found that while the expected range of native, widespread rodents, such as Mastomys natalensis was well captured in the IUCN ranges it lacked the additional information of non-detection that can be seen from trapping studies (Fig 3.). For invasive rodent species, IUCN ranges were less suitable, particularly for Mus musculus which is not shown to have any range in West Africa. Compared to GBIF data sampling locations were more widespread across the region with additional non-detection information available from rodent trapping studies. A discrepancy in the locations of Mus musculus was observed. GBIF data suggests widespread occurrence of this species in Togo which did not match data from several rodent trapping studies performed in this region.\n\n\n\nFig 3. Locations of detection and non-detection sites for rodent species in West Africa. Each row corresponds to a single rodent species. L) Presence recorded in GBIF (black points) overlaid on IUCN species range (red-shaded area). R) Detection (purple) and non-detection (orange) from rodent trapping studies overlaid on IUCN species ranges. M. musculus has no IUCN West African range.\n\n\nWe found that consolidating these three sources of data provided better coverage of a rodents detection and non-detection range than any individual source of data alone.\n\n\nHost-pathogen associations\nCLOVER is a dataset combining four host-pathogen association datasets: EcoHealth Alliance’s HP3, The University of Georgia’s Global Mammal Parasite Database, The University of Liverpool’s Enhanced Infectious Diseases 2 database and one shared through a publication by (Shaw et al. 2020). We compared the host-pathogen associations within this source with those we extracted from rodent trapping studies for both assays for acute infection (i.e. PCR) and evidence of prior infection (i.e. seroprevalence).\nWe identified 25 host-pathogen pairs among 14 rodent and 6 pathogen species (Fig 4. and Fig 5.). We identified negative associations (non-detection through specific assays) for 45 host-pathogen pairs among 35 rodent and 7 pathogen species. CLOVER contained 10 (40%) of our identified host-pathogen associations, the remaining 15 (60%) were not found to be present in CLOVER, additionally CLOVER recorded positive associations for 4 (9%) of the negative associations produced from the rodent trapping data.\n\n\n\nFig 4. Host-Pathogen associations detected through acute infection. A) Identified species level host-pathogen associations through detection of acute infection (i.e. PCR, culture). Percentages and colour relate to the proportion of all assays that were positive, the number of individuals tested for the pathogen is labelled N. Associations with a black border are present in the CLOVER dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 5. Host-Pathogen associations detected through evidence of prior infection. B) Identified species level host-pathogen associations through serological assays (i.e. ELISA). Percentages and colour relate to the proportion of all assays that were positive, the number of individuals tested for the pathogen is labelled N. Associations with a black border are present in the CLOVER dataset.\n\n\nCLOVER also included an additional 492 host-pathogen associations we do not observe in rodent trapping studies. The majority of these 392 (80%) pairs are from species with global distributions (M. musculus, R. rattus and R. norvegicus), or from those with wide ranging distributions in sub-Saharan Africa (38, 8%) (i.e., A. niloticus, M. natalensis and Atelerix albiventris).\nAn additional advantage of this data is that spatial information on the location of pathogen detection is available for some, while databases such as CLOVER do not contain locations or positive or negative results."

Together this supports their inclusion in efforts to model endemic zoonotic risk and novel pathogen emergence.\nFuture rodent trapping studies should be targeted towards regions that are currently under-studied. Further information on rodent presence and abundance across West Africa will aid the modelling of changing endemic zoonosis risk and the potential for novel pathogen emergence. Sharing of disaggregated data alongside research publications should be promoted with adoption of data standards to support ongoing data synthesis. Specifically, inclusion of exact locations of trapping sites, trapping effort and the dates at which trapping occurred would support more detailed inference of the spatio-temporal dynamics of host populations and the risk of endemic zoonosis spillover events. Despite these challenges we propose that rodent trapping studies can provide an important source of data to supplement curated datasets on rodent distributions to quantify the risk of endemic zoonosis spillover events and the hazard of novel pathogen emergence."

As multiple individuals are tested at each site, these are grouped points but explode if they are clicked. Selecting a point will split the point into samples from each species that was detected or not-detected at that site. In this way you will see some points have no samples tested. This is because individuals of that species were detected at that location but not tested. Purple points relate to presence of the microorganism, orange the absence. Further information includes the Rodent species, the Number of samples tested, the Number of positive samples, and the time period of sampling.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{simons2022,\n  author = {David Simons},\n  title = {A Web-Based Application to Explore Rodent Trapping Data.},\n  date = {2022-11-02},\n  url = {https://diddrog11.shinyapps.io/scoping_review_app/},\n  langid = {en},\n  abstract = {As part of my review on rodent trapping studies as an\n    overlooked information source for understanding zoonotic spillover I\n    produced a Shiny application that allows exploration of the data.\n    This current version has not been updated with manuscript.

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nFollowing introduction of ASF to Georgia in 2007 an ongoing epidemic is being reported by Russia and other East- and Central-European countries (Chenais et al. 2018). Over the last 14 years the invasion front of ASF has progressed West despite significant attempts (i.e. active and passive surveillance, mandatory reporting, animal culls) to arrest the geographic expansion of the outbreak (European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) et al. 2021). In July 2021, infected domestic pigs were reported in Eastern Germany in the buffer zone along the border with Poland for the first time (ProMED 2021).\nASF is introduced to farmed pig populations through several mechanisms. First, contamination of animal feedstocks with infected pig meat products (as was implicated in Portugal in 1957), can result in human driven transmission of disease (Sur 2019). Second, viral spillover from infected wild animals (e.g. warthogs, boar) into farmed pigs - particularly in settings of low biosecurity - including those in “backyard” pig farms. Third, arthropod vector driven transmission, the discovery of vector competence of soft-bodied Ornithodoros ticks increases risk of transmission where wild animals, vectors and domestic pigs distributions overlap (Costard et al. 2009).\nThe speed of the ASF invasion front across Europe depends on the interplay between these transmission methods and environmental factors (Gervasi and Guberti 2021). For example, maintenance within a wild population is affected by environmental degradation of wild animal corpses following ASF mortality, colder weather results in contaminated material persisting in a geographic location for a longer period of time (Carlson et al. 2020). Human activity through infrastructure networks, hunting activity and pig cultivation are further associated with ASF spread (Oļševskis et al. 2020). Current estimates for the rate of spread of ASF through wild boar populations range from 3km/month to 11km/month predominantly based on land classification (Podgórski, Apollonio, and Keuling 2018). Estimates of spread of the invasion front are complicated by translocation of the disease by human activity (i.e. transport of infected pigs or pig products) and unobserved spread. In 2018 infected wild boars were found in Belgium, over 500km from the nearest affected region, phylogenetic investigation identified cases from the Baltic states as being the closest viral relatives (Garigliany et al. 2019). Further, increased wild boar populations in urban and peri-urban settings across Europe can increase contact rates between this potential wild reservoir and humans with increased risk of human vectored ASF transmission (Mwiine et al. 2019).\nHere, we explore ASF spread through contiguous regions of mainland Europe as a non-linear spatial process using Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) to identify properties that may lead to an increased or decreased rate of spread. Characterising the invasion front in this way may allow early identification of regions at greatest or imminent risk of emergent cases. To achieve this we use the OIE WAHIS database of reported outbreaks to model the changing hazard of infection in European regions. These geographically and temporally altering hazards inform a model of speed of pathogen spread across these landscapes. Finally we predict expansion of the invasion front using these methods to currently uninfected regions of Central Europe."

    "section": "Methods",
    "text": "Methods\n\nASF case data\nASF is a listed disease and therefore notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) who maintain an open repository of reports contributed by member countries on the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS). We use a previously developed API to collate these reports and describe the current extent of ASF in the study region (World Organisation for Animal Health 2021). ASF case notifications up to October 2021 were obtained and grouped by geographically defined outbreaks. We retained the first notified case in wild boar (species name) and domesticated pigs (species name) in each administrative region for the subsequent analysis. We used month as our temporal unit of analysis throughout, therefore, outbreaks were identified to their month.\n\n\n\nRegions within Europe that have reported ASF cases. This highlights that reporting of cases is increasingly coming from the Western bounds of current outbreaks.\n\n\n\n\nGeographic units of analysis\nWe obtained shapefiles for level 3 administrative area from 11 European countries (Albania, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Finland, France, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland and Spain), level 2 administrative areas from 25 European countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Belarus, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Georgia, Hungary, Kosovo, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine and Switzerland) and level 1 administrative areas for 6 countries (Andorra, Armenia, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Montenegro and North Macedonia). All shapefiles were accessed through the Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM). The selection of level of administrative area used was based on data on data availability (not all countries use level 3 administrative areas) and feasibility. We removed Eastern Russia from the study area due to an outbreak of ASF in East Asia during the study period which introduced confounding through spillover of cases into the region from China and North Korea.\n\n\nCovariates\nWe selected a priori covariates of interest based on a review of the available literature and a conceptual model of ASF transmission within both wild and domesticed suids and the transmission between these two populations (Supplementary 1). We calculated the proportion of a countries GDP that was associated with pig production by obtaining the national pig population reported to FAOSTAT (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and Food and Agriculture Organisation 2021) divided this by the countries Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to produce a pig/GDP ratio. We used two bioclimatic variables derived from the WorldClim dataset [ref], first, we used isothermality - a measure of how large the diurnal temperatures oscillate relative to annual oscillations - and second, we used annual precipitation. The median of these variables were calculated for the administrative area unit of analysis. We used land elevation as a further measure of abiotic factors, we obtained land elevation from the European Environment Agency and calculated the median elevation for each administrative area. We obtained landuse data from the European Space Agency Copernicus project and we extracted the modal land use category for each administrative region.\nTo include the distribution of pig populations across our study area we obtained global farmed pig populations from the Gridded Livestock of the World v3 (2018), areal-weighted data were used which calculates the density of animals per km^2 multiplied by the pixel area. We used these data to produce a median value for pig density per km^2 for each included administrative area. Unfortunately, similar estimates for boar populations did not cover the extent of our study area so we used boars presence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility data we used reported presence since 2005-01-01 as our cut-off. We designated administrative regions without a reported boar presence since 2005 as boar not present.\nFinally, we included two measures of human impact on this system, first, median human population density was derived using the same approach as for pigs from Gridded Population of the World data. Second, a measure of human accessibility of “friction” was obtained from the Malaria Atlas Project, the median travel time to the nearest city for each administrative region was calculated, higher values represent less built-up regions that may be more suitable for maintaining both pig farming and wild boar populations.\n\n\nTemporal analysis\nWe explored the changing hazard of outbreaks over the study period by creating time-to-event data for a region to report an ASF outbreak. We used a Piece-wise exponential additive model (PEMs) a special case of GAMs to report the cumulative hazard estimate of an outbreak in an administrative region (Bender, Groll, and Scheipl 2018). These models were constructed for each country that had reported an outbreak during the study period.\n\n\nSpatial analysis\nWe used a GAM to model temporally and spatially varying hazards of an outbreak of ASF within an administrative region. The model used a soap film smooth for the spatio-temporal covariates to account for the geographic structure of the study region. We used thin plate regression splines for all other smoothed co-variates. The model was specified as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Hazard of outbreak}_{monthly} \\sim {\\sf Poisson}({\\sf te}((x_{1}, k) * (x_{1}, k)) + {\\sf s}(x_{2}, k) + \\cdots {\\sf s}(x_{8}, k) + x_{9} + x_{10})\n\\]\nWhere x1 is the temporal (month) and spatial (longitude and latitude) soap smooth, x2 is the country random effect smooth, x3 is the isothermality smooth, x4 is the precipitation smooth, x5 is the landscape “friction” smooth, x6 is the human population density smooth, x7 is the pig population density smooth, x8 is the regional elevation smooth, x9 is the binary presence or absence of boar in a region, x10 is the categorical dominant land use type in a region. For the soap film smooth we generated the boundary as a contiguous border of mainland Europe and implemented x internal knots."

    "text": "Temporary smoking episodes after the quit date (‘lapses’) often lead to full relapse. Real-time support delivered via technology-mediated just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) offer a promising means of preventing lapses. To inform JITAI development, we used observational data from a popular smoking cessation app (‘Smoke Free’) to develop supervised machine learning algorithms to distinguish lapse from non-lapse reports at the group- and individual-level.\nWe used data from app users with ≥20 unprompted craving feature entries within 3 months from the date of app registration, which included information about craving severity, mood, activity, social context, and lapse incidence. A series of group-level supervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) were trained and tested. Their ability to classify lapses for out-of-sample i) observations and ii) individuals were evaluated. Finally, a series of individual-level and hybrid (i.e., group- and individual-level) algorithms were trained and tested. A total of 791 participants were included, who provided 37,002 craving feature entries (7.6% lapses). The best-performing group-level algorithm had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.969 (95% CI = 0.961-0.978). Its ability to classify lapses for out-of-sample individuals ranged from poor to excellent (AUC = 0.482-1.000).\nIndividual-level algorithms could be constructed for 39/791 participants with sufficient data, with a median AUC of 0.938 (range: 0.518 to 1.000). For 31/39 participants, the individual-level algorithm led to improved performance compared with the group-level algorithm. Hybrid algorithms could be constructed for 184/791 participants and had a median AUC of 0.825 (range: 0.375 to 1.000). Using unprompted app data appeared feasible for constructing a high-performing group-level lapse classification algorithm but its performance was variable when applied to unseen individuals. Separate algorithms trained and tested on each individual’s dataset led to improved performance but could only be constructed for a minority of participants. Triangulation of results with those from a prompted study design is recommended prior to developing and evaluating a JITAI.\nThis work (Perski et al. 2022) is currently a pre-print and is under review."
