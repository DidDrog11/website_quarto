### COVID-19 transmission and control strategies

The COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the potential impact from emerging zoonotic infectious diseases. During the early stages of the pandemic I supported CMMID at LSHTM with their data management pipeline and was a member of the COVID-19 working group. As case numbers in the UK increased after the summer I reduced my role in the epidemiological and modelling work to increase the amount of time I could contribute to the clinical response.

### COVID-19 and the association with smoking

Since March 2020 I have also been involved in a project investigating the association of smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 severity and mortality. This work has been led by [Olga Perski](https://www.olgaperski.com) and colleagues at [UCL-Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/epidemiology-health-care/research/behavioural-science-and-health/research/ucl-tobacco-alcohol-research-group-utarg).

Current and former smoking is associated with worse outcomes and increased rates of hospitalisation from respiratory infections such as Respiratory Synciatial Virus, Influenza viruses and bacterial infections. Because of this there was an early concern about how the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 may interact with smoking.

Early data released from healthcare services in China in the early parts of 2020 suggested that smoking was not a significant risk factor for COVID-19 disease. Whether this was a true effect or reflected poor recording or reporting was unclear. We began to synthesise the published and pre-print literature to investigate the specific association of smoking and COVID-19. This was initially performed as a report for the Royal College of Physicians, London and was expanded following a request from Public Health England.

## Risk of COVID-19 in individuals with Sickle Cell Disease

Another group that were potentially at greater risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 infection were individuals suffering with Sickle Cell Disease. We wrote a commentary piece to draw attention to this group of individuals who are more prevalent in sub-Saharan countries in Africa that also suffer from a further burden of often under-developed healthcare infrastructure [@dexter_mitigating_2020]

Along with colleagues from the PANDORA network we tried to identify the countries that could be at greatest risk of importation of cases early in the epidemic based off flight data [@haider_passengers_2020]

## Omicron response work

### Vaccine effectiveness

Following the emergence and rapid spread of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2 there was substantial interest in the effectiveness of current vaccines. A test-negative case-control design was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease compared to the previously circulating Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. We observed that primary vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 vaccine provided limited protection against symptomatic disease. Booster vaccination following a completed primary course increased protection, but protection waned over time [@andrews2022covid]. This work has been published in the [New England Journal of Medicine](https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2119451)

### Variant detection

Within UKHSA we were fortunate that we could monitor the emergence of Omicron against the background of the prior Delta wave. This was possible as many of the laboratories conducting surveillance were able to detect S-gene target failure allowing differentiation between Omicron and Delta. This led to rapid identification of possible Omicron cases, alongside real-time surveillance and modelling of Omicron growth. This was key to initial public health action (including case identification and incident management), and we share applied insights on how and when these surveillance approaches can inform public health interventions[@blomquist2022enhancing]. This work has been published in [*Eurosurveillance*](https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2022.27.11.2200143).

### Comparing transmission of Omicron and Delta

This epidemiological study assessed differences in transmissibility between the Omicron and Delta. We used contact tracing data alongside national surveillance to estimate the transmission parameters. We found that the proportion of index cases resulting in a cluster of transmission was twice as high for Omicron (16.1%) compared to Delta (7.3%). Our study identified increased risk of onward transmission of Omicron, consistent with its successful global displacement of Delta [@allen2022comparative].

### The use of clinical assessment tools in UK hospitals

In my clinical role I was involved in a large scale audit of the use of the 4C COVID mortality score. The 4C Mortality Score (4C Score) was designed to risk stratify hospitalised patients with COVID-19. We assessed the inclusion of this score in COVID-19 management guidance and its documentation in patientsâ€™ case notes in January 2021 in UK hospitals. We found that score documentation in case notes was highly variable. Higher documentation of 4C Score was associated with score integration within admissions proformas, inclusion of 4C Score variables or link to online calculator, and management decisions. Integration of 4C Score within clinical pathways may encourage more widespread use [@blunsum2021evaluation]. This work is currently registered as a pre-print on [MedRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.18.21268003)
