	abstract = {Novel Coronavirus (2019-{nCoV} [{SARS}-{COV}-2]) was detected in humans during the last week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27 countries and territories as of 5 February 2020. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-{nCoV} through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1–31 January 2020 from {FLIRT}, an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019-{nCoV} transmission based on the number of travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization ({WHO}). We ranked each country based on the risk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The risk index of 2019-{nCoV} among the countries had a very high correlation with the {WHO}-reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia ({COVID}-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4th quantile of the risk index, two in the 3rd quantile, one in the 2nd quantile and none in the 1st quantile. Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-{nCoV} transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the {USA}, all of which reported at least one case. In pan-Europe, {UK}, France, Russia, Germany and Italy; in North America, {USA} and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of them reported at least one case. In Africa and South America, the risk of transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the countries where at least one case is detected. The risk of transmission on 31 January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe ({UK}, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America ({USA} and Canada). Increased public health response including early case recognition, isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening, public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of further spread to naïve countries.},

ideal for pathogen evolution.1 In humans, coronavirus is usually associated with mild
disease, the common cold. Previous emerging novel coronaviruses, such as {SARS}-{CoV}
and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}), which emerged in the
Middle East in 2012, were associated with severe and sometimes fatal disease.},

	abstract = {Peste des petits ruminants ({PPR}) is a contagious and often fatal transboundary animal disease affecting mostly sheep, goats and wild small ruminants. This disease is endemic in most of Africa, the Middle, Near East, and large parts of Asia. The causal agent is peste des petits ruminants virus ({PPRV}), which belongs to the genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. This genus also includes measles virus ({MV}), canine distemper virus ({CDV}) and rinderpest virus ({RPV}). All are closely related viruses with serological cross reactivity. In this study, we have developed a Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System ({LIPS}) for the rapid detection of antibodies against {PPRV} in serum samples and for specific differentiation from antibodies against {RPV}. {PPR} and rinderpest ({RP}) serum samples were assayed by {PPR}-{LIPS} and two commercially available {PPR} {cELISA} tests. The {PPR}-{LIPS} showed high sensitivity and specificity for the samples tested and showed no cross reactivity with {RPV} unlike the commercial {PPR} {cELISA} tests which did cross react with {RPV}. Based on the results shown in this study, {PPR}-{LIPS} is presented as a good candidate for the specific serosurveillance of {PPR}.},
