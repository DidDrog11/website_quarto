	abstract = {Novel Coronavirus (2019-{nCoV} [{SARS}-{COV}-2]) was detected in humans during the last week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27 countries and territories as of 5 February 2020. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-{nCoV} through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1–31 January 2020 from {FLIRT}, an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019-{nCoV} transmission based on the number of travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization ({WHO}). We ranked each country based on the risk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The risk index of 2019-{nCoV} among the countries had a very high correlation with the {WHO}-reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia ({COVID}-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4th quantile of the risk index, two in the 3rd quantile, one in the 2nd quantile and none in the 1st quantile. Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-{nCoV} transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the {USA}, all of which reported at least one case. In pan-Europe, {UK}, France, Russia, Germany and Italy; in North America, {USA} and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of them reported at least one case. In Africa and South America, the risk of transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the countries where at least one case is detected. The risk of transmission on 31 January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe ({UK}, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America ({USA} and Canada). Increased public health response including early case recognition, isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening, public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of further spread to naïve countries.},

	abstract = {Peste des petits ruminants ({PPR}) is a contagious and often fatal transboundary animal disease affecting mostly sheep, goats and wild small ruminants. This disease is endemic in most of Africa, the Middle, Near East, and large parts of Asia. The causal agent is peste des petits ruminants virus ({PPRV}), which belongs to the genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. This genus also includes measles virus ({MV}), canine distemper virus ({CDV}) and rinderpest virus ({RPV}). All are closely related viruses with serological cross reactivity. In this study, we have developed a Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System ({LIPS}) for the rapid detection of antibodies against {PPRV} in serum samples and for specific differentiation from antibodies against {RPV}. {PPR} and rinderpest ({RP}) serum samples were assayed by {PPR}-{LIPS} and two commercially available {PPR} {cELISA} tests. The {PPR}-{LIPS} showed high sensitivity and specificity for the samples tested and showed no cross reactivity with {RPV} unlike the commercial {PPR} {cELISA} tests which did cross react with {RPV}. Based on the results shown in this study, {PPR}-{LIPS} is presented as a good candidate for the specific serosurveillance of {PPR}.},

	abstract = {{SARS}-{CoV}-2 is the causative agent of {COVID}-19, an emergent zoonotic disease which has reached pandemic levels and is designated a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organisation. Early data suggest that older age, male sex and a diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes independently increase the risk of hospitalisation and death from {COVID}-19; however, the biological mechanisms underpinning these associations are currently unclear. The {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus enters human cells through the {ACE}2 receptor. Current and past tobacco smoking is associated with changes in the {ACE}2 receptor expression, hypertension, diabetes and worse outcomes following other viral infections. It is hence plausible that smoking is an independent risk factor for hospitalisation and death from {COVID}-19. Here, we review available evidence for an association between smoking status and hospitalisation for {COVID}-19. We highlight concerns regarding the quality of available data and call for more systematic collection of smoking status in future studies.},

Methods: \&nbsp;This case-control study enrolled adult patients (446 cases and 211 controls) at a single National Health Service trust in London, {UK}. The outcome variable was type of hospitalisation ({COVID}-19 vs. another respiratory virus a year previous). The exposure variable was smoking status (never/former/current smoker). Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and comorbidities were performed. The study protocol and analyses were pre-registered in April 2020 on the Open Science Framework . Results: \&nbsp;Current smokers had lower odds of being hospitalised with {COVID}-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous ({OR} adj =0.55, 95\% {CI}=0.31-0.96,\&nbsp; p =.04). There was no significant association among former smokers ({OR} adj =1.08, 95\% {CI}=0.72-1.65,\&nbsp; p =.70). Smoking status recorded on the {EHR} (compared with the contemporaneous medical notes) was incorrectly recorded for 168 (79.6\%) controls (χ 2 (3)=256.5,\&nbsp; p =\&lt;0.001) and 60 cases (13.5\%) (χ 2 (3)=34.2,\&nbsp; p =\&lt;0.001). Conclusions: \&nbsp;In a single {UK} hospital trust, current smokers had reduced odds of being hospitalised with {COVID}-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous, although it is unclear whether this association is causal. Targeted post-discharge recording of smoking status may account for the greater {EHR}-medical notes concordance observed in cases compared with controls.},

	abstract = {Background The {SARS}-{CoV}-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) has rapidly replaced the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) to become dominant in England. This epidemiological study assessed differences in transmissibility between the Omicron and Delta using two methods and data sources.
Methods Omicron and Delta cases were identified through genomic sequencing, genotyping and S-gene target failure in England from 5-11 December 2021. Secondary attack rates for Omicron and Delta using named contacts and household clustering were calculated using national surveillance and contact tracing data. We used multivariable logistic regression was used to control for factors associated with transmission.
Findings Analysis of contact tracing data identified elevated secondary attack rates for Omicron vs Delta in household (15.0\% vs 10.8\%) and non-household (8.2\% vs 3.7\%) settings. The proportion of index cases resulting in residential clustering was twice as high for Omicron (16.1\%) compared to Delta (7.3\%). Transmission was significantly less likely from cases, or in named contacts, in receipt of three compared to two vaccine doses in household settings, but less pronounced for Omicron ({aRR} 0.78 and 0.88) compared to Delta ({aRR} 0.62 and 0.68). In non-household settings, a similar reduction was observed for Delta cases and contacts ({aRR} 0.84 and 0.51) but only for Omicron contacts ({aRR} 0.76, 95\% {CI}: 0.58-0.93) and not cases in receipt of three vs two doses ({aRR} 0.95, 0.77-1.16).
Interpretation Our study identified increased risk of onward transmission of Omicron, consistent with its successful global displacement of Delta. We identified a reduced effectiveness of vaccination in lowering risk of transmission, a likely contributor for the rapid propagation of Omicron.

Higher documentation of 4C Score was associated with score integration within admissions proformas, inclusion of 4C Score variables or link to online calculator, and management decisions. Integration of 4C Score within clinical pathways may encourage more widespread use.},
